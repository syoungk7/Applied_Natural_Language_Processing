# Applied_Natural_Language_Processing
GT  CSE 8803 - Fall 2023

### Objective

Analyze NLP techniques and apply them to text data. The course is divided into three main categories:

- Preprocessing: Demonstrate how to clean and integrate text data
- Processing: Apply NLP algorithms on your pre-processed data to perform different tasks
- Post-processing: Evaluate your developed NLP models.

Solve problems with real datasets Apply practical know-how (useful for jobs, and research) through significant hands-on programming assignments


1. Text data preprocessing: Normalization, lemmatization, stemming, stop words removal…
2. Text Representations: One hot encoding, BoW (frequency counting), TF-IDF
3. Classification, Naive Bayes, Classification Model Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
4. Logistic Regression, SVM, Perceptron
5. SVD (Dimensionality Reduction) + Co-occurrence embeddings, Glove
6. Neural Network (fully connected), Word2vec: CBoW, Skip-Gram
7. CNN, RNN
8. LSTM and GRU, LSTM + Attention (Focus on Attention mechanism)
9. Transformer models, its Examples: BERT and GPT
10. Sequence Labelling: POS Tagging and NER
11. Unsupervised Models
12. Topic Modeling (Latent Semantic Indexing, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
