Using symbolic computation, spectral Green's functions, suitable for numerical implementations are determined in compact and closed forms. Applications are presented for structures with two dielectric layers.\n",

      "1 - ECE: A multifunctional platform based on the microhotplate was developed for applications including a Pirani vacuum gauge, temperature, and gas sensor. It consisted of a tungsten microhotplate and an on-chip operational amplifier. The platform was fabricated in a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. A tungsten plug in standard CMOS process was specially designed as the serpentine resistor for the microhotplate, acting as both heater and thermister. With the sacrificial layer technology, the microhotplate was suspended over the silicon substrate with a 340 nm gap. The on-chip operational amplifier provided a bias current for the microhotplate. This platform has been used to develop different kinds of sensors. The first one was a Pirani vacuum gauge ranging from 10(-1) to 10(5) Pa. The second one was a temperature sensor ranging from -20 to 70 degrees C. The third one was a thermal-conductivity gas sensor, which could distinguish gases with different thermal conductivities in constant gas pressure and environment temperature. In the fourth application, with extra fabrication processes including the deposition of gas-sensitive film, the platform was used as a metal-oxide gas sensor for the detection of gas concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 - Civil: Artificial neural networks have been effectively used in various civil engineering fields, including construction management and labour productivity. In this study, the performance of the feed forward neural network (FFNN) was compared with radial basis neural network (RBNN) in modelling the productivity of masonry crews. A variety of input factors were incorporated and analysed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate model performance. Research results indicated that the neural computing techniques could be successfully employed in modelling crew productivity. It was also found that successful models could be developed with different combinations of input factors, and several of the models which excluded one or more input factors turned out to be better than the baseline models. Based on the MAPE values obtained for the models, the RBNN technique was found to be better than the FFNN technique, although both slightly overestimated the masons' productivity.\n",

For the word2vec model, context is represented as N words before and N words after the current word. N is a hyperparameter. With larger N we can create better embeddings, but at the same time, such a model requires more computational resources. \n",

    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers are used to find patterns by sliding a small kernel window over the input. In computer vision applications, the kernel window slides through and gets multiplied by small regions in an image. In the context of NLP, the kernel slides through and gets multiplied by the embedding vectors of a few words as specified by window size. For looking at sequences of word embeddings, the window has to look at multiple word embeddings in a sequence. The kernel will be rectangular with size window_size x embedding_size. For example, if window size is 3 then the kernel size will be 3 x 500. This essentially represents n-grams in the model. The kernel weights (filter) are multiplied to word embeddings in pairs and summed up to get output values. As the network is being learned, these kernel weights are also being learned.\n",

    "We will be implementing a convolutional neural network with a pre-trained word2vec model for classification similar to the CNN-rand baseline described by [Kim (2014)](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1181.pdf). Although our model differs from the paper, it may still be helpful to review the model section of the paper to get a general overview of the architecture. We will use a pre-trained word2vec model for feasibility of finding the appropriate embeddings. The architecture of our model looks like:\n",
