0,"A hardware accelerator is presented to compute the probabilistic inference for a Bayesian network (BN) in distributed sensing applications. For energy efficiency, the accelerator is operated at a near-threshold voltage of 0.5 V, while achieving a maximum clock frequency of 33 MHz. Clique-tree message passing algorithm is leveraged to compute the probabilistic inference. The theoretical maximum size of a factor that the proposed hardware accelerator can handle is 2((8x20)=160) entries, which is sufficient for handling massive BNs, such as PATHFINDER, MUNIN, and so on (>1000 nodes). A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism (ALARM) BN is used to benchmark the performance of the accelerator. The accelerator consumes 76 nJ to execute the ALARM network using a clique-tree message-passing algorithm, while the same algorithm executed on an ultralow-power microcontroller consumes 20 mJ.

The simulation runs are carried out via a cloud-based framework that combines multiple, distributed computing resources. A user-friendly graphical user interface ensures that minimal knowledge about the background operations is required. In order to exemplify the capabilities of this approach an EOS for ethylene oxide is created and compared to data from the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

3,"A parallel time integration method for nonlinear partial differential equations is proposed. It is based on a new implementation of the Paraexp method for linear partial differential equations (PDEs) employing a block Krylov subspace method. For nonlinear PDEs the algorithm is based on our Paraexp implementation within a waveform relaxation. The initial value problem is solved iteratively on a complete time interval. Nonlinear terms are treated as source terms, provided by the solution from the previous iteration. At each iteration, the problem is decoupled into independent subproblems by the principle of superposition. The decoupled subproblems are solved fast by exponential integration, based on a block Krylov method. The new time integration is demonstrated for the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical experiments confirm excellent parallel scaling for the linear advection-diffusion problem, and good scaling in case the nonlinear Burgers equation is simulated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

4,"A redundant system of collocated geodetic sensors and an accelerometer were used to measure the displacements of a stiff, 40-m-long footbridge excited by essentially vertical synchronized jumps. A main output of the measurements was that excitations produced vertical deflections (of the order of several mm), lateral deflections with an amplitude about half that of the vertical, an effect known for various bridges, and also smaller-scale longitudinal deflections, probably induced by the vertical ones. This combination of deflections in three axes is not an artifact of measuring errors, or of limitations of specific instruments, and do not reflect random effects, for they have been observed in different experiments by different sensors (Global Navigation Satellite System-GNSS, i.e., Global Positioning System-GPS plus the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System-GLONASS), robotic total stations-RTS (or robotic theodolite), and an accelerometer, and were tested through control of the measurement errors from time series reflecting no bridge oscillations. In all cases, sensors provided similar estimates of deflections and of deflection-derived dominant frequencies, which were found equal to those derived from the accelerometer. The proposed instrumentation and methodology seem suitable to control deflections of bridges in cases that visibility of satellites is poor or is disrupted by vehicle circulation. Measurement-based modeling of bridges described might be useful for understanding the structural behavior of bridges under several types of dynamic loads and can contribute to the displacement-based design of structures.

5,"After intense scientific exploration and more than a decade of failed trials, Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a fatal global epidemic. A traditional research and drug development paradigm continues to target heterogeneous late-stage clinically phenotyped patients with single 'magic bullet' drugs. Here, we propose that it is time for a paradigm shift towards the implementation of precision medicine (PM) for enhanced risk screening, detection, treatment, and prevention of AD. The overarching structure of how PM for AD can be achieved will be provided through the convergence of breakthrough technological advances, including big data science, systems biology, genomic sequencing, blood-based biomarkers, integrated disease modeling and P4 medicine. It is hypothesized that deconstructing AD into multiple genetic and biological subsets existing within this heterogeneous target population will provide an effective PM strategy for treating individual patients with the specific agent(s) that are likely to work best based on the specific individual biological make-up. The Alzheimer's Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) is an international collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted towards the implementation of PM in Neurology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience. It is hypothesized that successful realization of PM in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will result in breakthrough therapies, such as in oncology, with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses, particularly through biomarker-guided early preclinical disease-stage clinical trials.

6,"A current major challenge in leprosy control is the prevention of permanent disabilities. Host pathological inflammatory responses termed type 1 reaction (T1R) are a leading cause of nerve damage for leprosy patients. The environmental or inherited factors that predispose leprosy cases to undergo T1R are not known. However, studies have shown an important contribution of host genetics for susceptibility to T1R. We have previously identified variants encompassing the TNFSF15/TNFSF8 genes as T1R risk factors in a Vietnamese sample and replicated this association in a Brazilian sample. However, we failed to validate in Brazilian patients the strong association of TNFSF15/TNFSF8 markers rs6478108 and rs7863183 with T1R that we had observed in Vietnamese patients. Here, we investigated if the lack of validation of these variants was due to age-dependent effects on association using four independent population samples, two from Brazil and two from Vietnam. In the combined analysis across the four samples, we observed a strong association of the TNFSF15/TNFSF8 variants rs6478108, rs7863183, and rs3181348 with T1R (p(combined) = 1.5E-05, p(combined) = 1.8E-05, and p(combined) = 6.5E-06, respectively). However, the association of rs6478108 with T1R was more pronounced in leprosy cases under 30 years of age compared to the global sample [odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.54-2.46, p(combined) = 2.5E-08 versus OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.23-1.73, p(combined) = 1.5E-05]. A multivariable analysis indicated that the association of rs6478108 with T1R was independent of either rs7863183 or rs3181348. These three variants are known regulators of the TNFSF8 gene transcription level in multiple tissues. The age dependency of association of rs6478108 and T1R suggests that the genetic control of gene expression varies across the human life span.

7,"Action recognition, aiming to automatically classify actions from a series of observations, has attracted more attention in the computer vision community. The state-of-the-art action recognition methods utilize dense sampled trajectories to build feature representations. However, their performances are limited due to action region clutters and camera motions in real world applications. No matter how the scenario changes in different backgrounds, the salient cues of actions are highly dependent on their appearances and motions. Based on this discovery, in this paper we propose a novel saliency-based dense sampling strategy named improved dense trajectories (iDT) on salient region-based contrast boundary (iDT-RCB). Without any external human detector, a robust mask is generated to overcome the limitations of global contrast based saliency in action sequences. Warped optical flow is exploited to adjust the interest points sampling to remove subtle motions. We show that an appropriate pruning of feature points can achieve a good balance between saliency and density of the sampled points. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. More specifically, the fusion of deep-learned features and our hand-crafted features can even improve the recognition performance over baseline dense sampling methods. In particular, the fusion scheme achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy at 73.8% and 94.8% on Hollywood2 and UCF50, respectively.

8,"A diversity antenna system with antennas embedded in rear view mirrors of a vehicle is proposed for satellite digital audio radio system. Antenna diversity is needed because hidden antennas exhibit limited capability and composite body vehicles have poor reception due to no ground plane availability. Pattern gain diversity achieved with the proposed system is proven with on-vehicle antenna simulations and gain measurements. Selection combining diversity receiver architecture is also proposed and the system is tested in real time under two fading scenarios: weak satellite signal in dense foliage and multipath terrestrial environment with frequent satellite blockages. In both cases, the diversity system outperformed the reference antenna system with less mutes times (0.6% versus 0.8% in multipath, 0.1% versus 0.25% in dense foliage) and Reed-Solomon block errors (1.75% versus 2.18% in multipath, 0.87% versus 1.18% in dense foliage). The proposed rear-view mirror location is ideal for minimum signal degradation compared to windshield, backlite, and dashboard antenna installations.

9,"A new model of power-assisted bicycle has been designed, set up and tested. The main innovative solutions for the pedelec prototype are described in the present paper: the electric motor position; the new mechanical transmission; the low cost measurement system of the driving torque; the special test rig. Differently from a common approach, in which the electric motor is located on one of the three hubs of the bicycle, the idea of the pedelec prototype consists of an electrical motor in the central position that, by means of a bevel gear, transmits the torque on the central hub. The other innovative solution is represented by the motion transmission from the motor to the pedal shaft, achieved by two different gearboxes: the first one is a planetary gearbox and the second one is a simple bevel gear. The pedelec prototype contains also a new low cost measurement system of the driving torque based on a strain gauge load cell located on one side of the rear wheel, between the hub and the frame. Moreover, a commercial cycling simulator has been suitably modified in order to properly install the different sensors for the measurement of the performance of the pedelec. The test rig is able to reproduce an aforethought route or paths acquired during road tests, to measure the performance of the e-bike in terms of instantaneous power and speed. The experimental test rig can simulate the resistant torque of a predetermined track and it aims to test and to optimize the control strategy available on the electronic control unit. The authors have also conducted an environmental analysis of the developed pedelec, in particular comparing the e-bike with a thermal moped, in terms of environmental impact. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Delay line signal processing technique, developed by a few previous researchers, is used to develop the signal flow graph of different ring resonator architectures, and a rule, already established by a previous investigator, is implemented to determine its overall transmittance. Frequency responses of three different ring resonator architectures are presented in the article. The parameters describing the performance of optical filter can be directly estimated from the frequency response plot. The simulated results of single and double ring architectures are compared with those of previously published results. A waveguide based triple ring resonator architecture is proposed, and its frequency response analysis is carried out in the article. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

11,"Ambient intelligence technologies are making our daily life increasingly virtual, and the boundary between the real world and the virtual world is gradually disappearing. Computer games are often played on the Internet, which allows people to enjoy games with others, even when they are not at the same location. This paper analyzes the Trading Card Game (TCG), which has two versions. One version is played with paper-based cards, whereas the other is played on a computer. The computer-based TCG supports remote play and has a number of enhancements, such as providing special fictional effects on virtual cards. The two different versions are useful to analyze the influence of virtuality in making future social interaction more playful. First, we investigate potential pitfalls to introduce virtuality in TCG through the scenario-based analysis, which adopts a player's personality to exploit potential difficulties. For investigating further insights on the influence of virtuality in TCG, we analyze some experiments with Augmented Trading Card Game, where a real opponent player is replaced with a fictional player. Our findings from the analyses show that the feeling of realness is essential to make incorporated virtuality successful. Recently some games' concepts can be adopted in order to augment our real world. It is essential to investigate the influence of virtuality introduced with the games. The future social interaction will incorporate virtuality based on a variety of game-like features to make the interaction more playful. Therefore, the insights described in this paper will be useful to help the design of future playful social interaction.

13,"Agitation associated with dementia is frequently reported clinically but has received little attention in preclinical models of dementia. The current study used a 7PA2 CM intracerebroventricular injection model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to assess acute memory impairment, and a bilateral intrahippocampal (IH) injection model of AD (aggregated A beta(1-42) injections) and a bilateral IH injection model of dementia with Lewy bodies (aggregated NAC(61-95) injections) to assess chronic memory impairment in the rat. An alternating-lever cyclic-ratio schedule of operant responding was used for data collection, where incorrect lever perseverations measured executive function (memory) and running response rates (RRR) measured behavioral output (agitation). The results indicate that bilateral IH injections of A beta(1-42) and bilateral IH injections of NAC(61-95) decreased memory function and increased RRRs, whereas intracerebroventricular injections of 7PA2 CM decreased memory function but did not increase RRRs. These findings show that using the aggregated peptide IH injection models of dementia to induce chronic neurotoxicity, memory decline was accompanied by elevated behavioral output. This demonstrates that IH peptide injection models of dementia provide a preclinical screen for pharmacological interventions used in the treatment of increased behavioral output (agitation), which also establish detrimental side effects on memory.

15,"A high degree of uncertainty associated with the emission inventory for China tends to degrade the performance of chemical transport models in predicting PM2.5 concentrations especially on a daily basis. In this study a novel machine learning algorithm, Geographically -Weighted Gradient Boosting Machine (GW-GBM), was developed by improving GBM through building spatial smoothing kernels to weigh the loss function. This modification addressed the spatial nonstationarity of the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and predictor variables such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological conditions. GW-GBM also overcame the estimation bias of PM2.5 concentrations due to missing AOD retrievals, and thus potentially improved subsequent exposure analyses. GW-GBM showed good performance in predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations (R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 23.0 g/m(3)) even with partially missing AOD data, which was better than the original GBM model (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 25.3 g/m(3)). On the basis of the continuous spatiotemporal prediction of PM2.5 concentrations, it was predicted that 95% of the population lived in areas where the estimated annual mean PM2.5 concentration was higher than 35 g/m(3), and 45% of the population was exposed to PM2.5 >75 g/m(3) for over 100 days in 2014.

16,"A comprehensive ontology can ease the discovery, maintenance and popularization of knowledge in many domains. As a means to enhance existing ontologies, attribute extraction has attracted tremendous research attentions. However, most existing attribute extraction techniques focus on exploring a single type of sources, such as structured (e.g., relational databases), semi-structured (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML)) or unstructured sources (e.g., Web texts, images), which leads to the poor coverage of knowledge bases (KBs). This paper presents a framework for ontology augmentation by extracting attributes from four types of sources, namely existing knowledge bases (KBs), query stream, Web texts, and Document Object Model (DOM) trees. In particular, we use query stream and two major KBs, DBpedia and Freebase, to seed the attribute extraction from Web texts and DOM trees. We specially focus on exploring the extraction technique from DOM trees, which is rarely studied in previous works. Algorithms and a series of filters are developed. Experiments show the capability of our approach in augmenting existing KB ontology.

17,"A novel generalized pattern search (GPS)-based cellular automata (GPS-CA) model was developed to simulate urban land-use change in a GIS environment. The model is built on a fitness function that computes the difference between the observed results produced from remote-sensing images and the simulated results produced by a general CA model. GPS optimization incorporating genetic algorithms (GAs) searches for the minimum difference, i.e. the smallest accumulated residuals, in fitting the CA transition rules. The CA coefficients captured by the GPS method have clear physical meanings that are closely associated with the dynamic mechanisms of land-use change. The GPS-CA model was applied to simulate urban land-use change in Kunshan City in the Yangtze River Delta from 2000 to 2015. The results show that the GPS method had a smaller root mean squared error (0.2821) than a logistic regression (LR) method (0.5256) in fitting the CA transition rules. The GPS-CA model thus outperformed the LR-CA model, with an overall accuracy improvement of 4.7%. As a result, the GPS-CA model should be a superior tool for modeling land-use change as well as predicting future scenarios in response to different conditions to support the sustainable urban development.

This is why, the use of agent-oriented methodologies and frameworks is almost mandatory to easily develop software for AmI scenarios. ICARO is a software framework that promotes the use of different organizational and behavioral patterns to implement multi-agent systems (MAS). Its extensive use in several projects demonstrates a substantial increase in software productivity. Also, in order to reduce the coding effort it is usual to design MAS at a higher level. In this sense, code generation from MAS specifications into ICARO framework has been performed. INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK) supports both the specification of MAS models, including any feature required to implement MAS with ICARO, and a set of facilities for code generation. This paper describes the development of AmI applications thanks to the integration of ICARO and IDK.

20,"Acute angioedema attacks are conventionally treated with antihistamines and steroids, in line with a presumed mechanism of disease involving overwhelming mast-cell degranulation. This approach overlooks a small but important minority of cases in which attacks are bradykinin driven and exhibit poor responsiveness to steroid or anti-histamine therapy. These patients may have a family history of angioedema (hereditary angioedema), or a past medical history including B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune disease (acquired angioedema). Rather than steroid therapy, they respond to administration of a bradykinin inhibitor, or more commonly, a Cl esterase inhibitor substitute, to control acute symptoms and reduce the probability of invasive airway insertion. In the long-term, they require Cl esterase inhibitor sparing therapy and a treat-the-cause approach to reduce the risk of recurrent attacks.

22,"Agarwood formation in Aquilaria malaccensis could be artificially stimulated by fungal infection. Furthermore, A. malaccensis adapts to this infection by developing typical included phloem boundary within xylem tissues. Naturally synthesized agarwood requires a lengthy process of up to 30 years, which impedes its continuous production. Therefore, recent effort has been allocated to the elucidation of agarwood formation to stimulate its process rapidly. In this study, we artificially induced agarwood formation by injection and inoculation of cultivated Aquilaria malaccensis with four strains of Fusarium solani isolated from different places in Indonesia. The results showed that A. malaccensis responded differently upon wounding and fungal inoculations compared to healthy trees. All wounded and inoculated samples resulted in the formation of typical discoloration zone surrounding injection sites. Further anatomical observation revealed that both samples also developed included phloem structures in which resinous agarwood compounds were accumulated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the inoculated samples yielded some important agarwood compounds such as tridecanoic acid, alpha-santalol, and spathulenol, which were not present in both healthy controls and only wounded samples. Notably, one of the tested F. solani, strain Gorontalo displayed promising results as a candidate for artificially induced agarwood formation in A. malaccensis in terms of color, odor, and chemical constituents.

24,"A complexity of business dynamics often forces decision-makers to make decisions based on subjective mental models, reflecting their experience. However, research has shown that companies perform better when they apply data-driven decision-making. This creates an incentive to introduce intelligent, data based decision models, which are comprehensive and support the interactive evaluation of decision options necessary for the business environment. Recently, a new general explanation methodology has been proposed, which supports the explanation of state-of-the-art black-box prediction models. Uniform explanations are generated on the level of model/individual instance and support what-if analysis. We present a novel use of this methodology inside an intelligent system in a real-world case of business-to-business (B2B) sales forecasting, a complex task frequently done judgmentally. Users can validate their assumptions with the presented explanations and test their hypotheses using the presented what-if parallel graph representation. The results demonstrate effectiveness and usability of the methodology. A significant advantage of the presented method is the possibility to evaluate seller's actions and to outline general recommendations in sales strategy. This flexibility of the approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different applications. Our well-documented real-world case shows how to solve a decision support problem, namely that the best performing black-box models are inaccessible to human interaction and analysis. This could extend the use of the intelligent systems to areas where they were so far neglected due to their insistence on comprehensible models. A separation of the machine learning model selection from model explanation is another significant benefit for expert and intelligent systems. Explanations unconnected to a particular prediction model positively influence acceptance of new and complex models in the business environment through their easy assessment and switching.

32,"Abundance and seasonal trophodynamics (specific growth rate, daily production, and grazing mortality) of the major picophytoplankton components, Synechococcus cyanobacteria (Syn) and picoeukaryotes (Pico-E), were studied at three stations in Sevastopol Bay and adjacent coastal waters (the Black Sea) in 2014 by flow cytometry and the dilution method. Pico-E abundance was shown to increase along the nutrient and pollution gradient from the coastal waters outside the bay (annual average of 7.3 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)) to the eastern corner of the bay (28.7 +/- 11.4 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)), while no relation was found between the water pollution status and Syn abundance (9.9 +/- 8.7 x 10(3) cells mL(-1); at all the stations, n = 27). Matter flows through the communities (daily production for Syn and Pico-E 0(-1)6.6 and 0(-1)9.3 A mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively; grazing mortality for Syn and PicoE 0-3.6 and 0-21.2 A mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively) were comparable to or even exceeded their biomass stocks (>0.05-6.8 and 0.9-26.5 A mu g C L-1 for Syn and PicoE, respectively), indicating high biomass turnover rates. The highest flow-to-stock ratio (up to 6 for Syn) and a significant imbalance between daily production (P) and grazing mortality (G) were observed in the most polluted and eutrophic waters of the bay in spring (Pico-E: P/G1). Black River inflow to the bay was hypothesized to be among the mechanisms maintaining this pronounced and long-term imbalance in the open system without any negative consequences for the picophytoplankton assemblages.

A classic or laparoscopic approach is required by perforated DU, diagnosis responsible for the high percentage of deaths. In this case it is excluded the conservative treatment with proton pump inhibitors and the eradication of the infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP). Our study presents observations on the treatment of postoperative DU on a group of elderly patients (>60 years) with associated chronic diseases. The studied group includes patients hospitalized between 2005 - 2010 in the Department of Surgery, in Sf. Pantelimon, Sf. loan, and Coltea Hospitals. Of 186 emergency presentations, 23 were duodenal ulcer relapse, 126 perforated DU and GU 37 were cases of perforated GU. 15-16% were aged >60 years, mainly males. For cases of duodenal ulcer recurrence in the first aggressive manifestation or recurrent duodenal ulcer, treatment was instituted along with the terapeutical association regarding the type of diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, cirrhosis. For this situation, as for the treatment after surgery we considered national and international guidelines, as the consensus in 1996 in Maastricht ""European concept in the management of Helicobacter pilory infection"" and the 1997 U.S. ""American Digestive Health Foundation.""

36,"although the tendency towards a Semantic Web is increasing, the current Web is keen on more semantic data. There are several web application domains which need to present their data in the form of graphs to get information and knowledge to allow semantic web searching to deal with them. These domains can be for example geographic data, data in the area of bioinformatics, social networks or even corporate search engines. Most of these domains already store their data in relational database management systems which are not capable of being queried directly by semantic web applications. In this paper we will propose a semi-automated method to map the data from relational databases to RDF structures. This is true for both a single source database as well as different source databases. The results show a complexity of order n(2) where n is the number of records processed, when it comes to the performance in creating the output from mapping the relational database to RDF files.

38,"Analytical solutions of partial differential equation (PDE) models describing reactive transport phenomena in saturated porous media are often used as screening tools to provide insight into contaminant fate and transport processes. While many practical modelling scenarios involve spatially variable coefficients, such as spatially variable flow velocity, v(x), or spatially variable decay rate, k(x), most analytical models deal with constant coefficients. Here we present a framework for constructing exact solutions of PDE models of reactive transport. Our approach is relevant for advection-dominant problems, and is based on a regular perturbation technique. We present a description of the solution technique for a range of one-dimensional scenarios involving constant and variable coefficients, and we show that the solutions compare well with numerical approximations. Our general approach applies to a range of initial conditions and various forms of v(x) and k(x). Instead of simply documenting specific solutions for particular cases, we present a symbolic worksheet, as supplementary material, which enables the solution to be evaluated for different choices of the initial condition, v(x) and k(x). We also discuss how the technique generalizes to apply to models of coupled multispecies reactive transport as well as higher dimensional problems.

39,"A secure and safe authentication on a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is essential for network security. A safe data transmission requires integrity, availability and privacy protection features as well as efficient communication in diverse settings. Recently proposed security protocols for vehicular communication cannot authenticate in a complex way in areas of heavy traffic due to the increasing number of messages in proportion to the number of vehicles. For efficient communication, data volume need be reduced and communication should be safe against a range of attacks. Hence, the present paper proposes a protocol that accelerates message processing by sending a low data volume for communication in areas of heavy traffic and that blocks replay attacks by checking timestamps. In addition, CASPER/FDR (Lowe in Casper: a compiler for the analysis of security protocols. User Manual and Tutorial, Version 1.12, 2009; Formal Systems (Europe) Ltd in Failures-Divergence Renement.

It is the result of a systematic construction of a fast algorithm for an efficient implementation of the complete time domain aliasing cancellation (TDAC) analysis/synthesis MDCT/MDST filter banks. It is shown that the same computational structure can be used both for the encoder and the decoder, thus significantly reducing design time and resources. The corresponding generalized signal flow graph is regular and defines new sparse matrix factorizations of the discrete cosine transform of type IV (DCT-IV) and MDCT/MDST matrices. The identical fast MDCT computational structure provides an efficient implementation of the MDCT in MPEG layer III (MP3) audio coding and the Dolby Labs AC-3 codec.

42,"Adults' adaptive interactions with intimate partners enhance well-being. Here we hypothesized that adult males' physiological responses to opposite-sex conspecifics' distress result from an interaction between an environmental factor (early social interaction with caregivers) and a genetic factor (a polymorphism within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene, 5-HTTLPR). We assessed heart rate changes in 42 non-married male adults to distress vocalizations (female, infant, and bonobo cries). Males' early interaction with parents was assessed using the Parental Bonding Instrument. Buccal mucosa cell samples were collected to assess their 5-HTTLPR genotype. A significant interaction emerged between early experience and genetic predisposition. Males with a genetic predisposition for higher sensitivity to environmental factors showed atypical physiological responses to adult female cries according to their experienced early maternal parenting. Environmental experiences and genetic characteristics are associated with adult males' physiological responses to socially meaningfully stimuli. Understanding the mechanisms that modulate responses to opposite-sex conspecifics may improve personal well-being and social adaptiveness.

43,"A central idea in distance-based machine learning algorithms such k-nearest neighbors and manifold learning is to choose a set of references, or a neighborhood, based on a distance functions to represent the local structure around a query point and use the local structures as the basis to construct models. Local Partial Least Square (local PLS), which is the result of applying this neighborhood based idea in Partial Least Square (PLS), has been shown to perform very well on the regression of small-sample sized and multicollinearity data, but seldom used in high-dimensionality classification. Furthermore the difference between PLS and local PLS with respect to their optimal intrinsic dimensions is unclear. In this paper we combine local PLS with non-Euclidean distance in order to find out which measures are better suited for high dimensionality classification. Experimental results obtained on 8 UCI and spectroscopy datasets show that the Euclidean distance is not a good distance fiinction for use in local PLS classification, especially in high dimensionality cases; instead Manhattan distance and fractional distance are preferred. Experimental results further show that the optimal intrinsic dimension of local PLS is smaller than that of the standard PLS.

44,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate as a result of high concentrations of reactive aldehydes, oxidative stress, and insufficient degradation of glycated proteins. AGEs are therefore accepted biomarkers for aging, diabetes, and several degenerative diseases. Due to the Warburg effect and increased oxidative stress, cancer cells frequently accumulate significant amounts of AGEs. As the accumulation of AGEs may reflect the metabolic state and receptor signaling, we evaluated the potential prognostic and predictive value of this biomarker. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the AGE N epsilon-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) in 213 mammary carcinoma samples and Western blotting to detect AGEs in cell cultures. Whereas no significant correlation between hormone receptor status and CML was observed in cell lines, CML accumulation in tumors was positively correlated with the presence of estrogen receptor alpha, the postmenopausal state, and age. A negative correlation was found for grade III carcinomas and triple-negative cases. In a retrospective Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there was a statistical trend that high CML accumulation correlated with a more favorable prognosis (relapse-free survival, RFS) under tamoxifen treatment (p = 0.1). In estrogen receptor-negative cases, the high CML content was significantly correlated with an unfavorable outcome (RFS) of chemotherapy (p = 0.046). CML is a therefore a potentially predictive marker for the treatment of breast cancer patients with tamoxifen or chemotherapy.

45,"A computer vision-based autonomous fire suppression system with real-time feedback of fire size and spray direction is presented in this paper. The system has been developed for use in a firefighting robot for close-range, localized fire suppression tasks in enclosed environments. A probabilistic water classification method was developed for segmenting water spray in a pair of IR cameras. Stereo processing was performed to localize points along the spray path for use in yaw and pitch angle estimation. A Golden Section Search with linear least squares optimization was used to determine the optimal pitch angle of the spray position at each sampling time. Kalman filtering was used to remove noise from the angle measurements and obtain a better estimate of the current nozzle orientation. A decision tree was used to determine the correct nozzle positioning mode using image feedback to suppress the fire and accounts for errors in direction, fire size during suppression, and when to adjust the nozzle based on IR feedback. Through implementation of a PI controller, the system is able to correct for unknown disturbances causing erroneous targeting of a localized fire. Experiments are presented with the initial nozzle angled correctly and with forced offsets in the system to set the initial spray position incorrectly in order for the system to correct. Suppression times ranged from 7.2 s to 16.3 s with a standard deviation of 3.9 s and average time of 11.2 s. A total of 12 tests demonstrated performance of the system given a forced offset to the initial nozzle orientation resulting in an error between the spray location and the fire target. Suppression times ranged from 8.1 s to 27.9 s with a mean of 16.9 s and standard deviation of 6.2 s. The proposed system can be implemented on a robotic firefighting platform to autonomously detect a fire, choose a proper manipulation goal and suppress full scale fires given disturbances causing erroneous targeting.

The new formulation includes a term, in the dynamics equation, that depends on the most recent linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimate of the state. This can model the behavior of a feedback control system featuring a state estimator. The measurement equation is allowed to depend on the previous LMMSE estimate of the state, which can represent the fact that measurements are obtained from a validation window centered about the predicted measurement and not from the entire surveillance region. The LMMSE filter is derived for the considered problem. The approach is demonstrated in the context of target tracking in clutter and is shown to be competitive with several popular nonlinear methods.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors that project managers experience as having the greatest effect on time, cost, and quality, and to discover whether the effects of these factors are significantly different from each other. A questionnaire with 26 factors identified from interviews was sent to the full population of publicly employed project managers. Factors were ranked using the relative importance index and tested for significant differences using Friedman's test. Wilcoxon's test was used in a post-hoc analysis. From the findings it was determined that the most influential factor for time is unsettled or lack of project funding; for cost, errors or omissions in consultant material; and for quality, errors or omissions in construction work. The main conclusion of this research is that project schedule, budget, and quality level are affected in significantly different ways. Therefore, a project manager cannot handle such critical issues by focusing only on schedule or budget complications; nor can he or she assume that time, cost, and quality are equally affected.

50,"A recent electrophysiological study suggests existing compensatory brain activity as a mechanism for functional recovery of visual attention detection (the capacity for detecting external cues) in symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients. Despite such evidence, little is known about other aspects of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission, such as their capacity to concentrate on the task at hands without being interfered by distracting information. To this end, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 20 symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls while they engaged in a classic Stroop task. Symptomatically remitted patients showed comparable Stroop interference to healthy controls, indicating a degree of functional recovery of such a capacity in these patients. On the neural level, the N450 over the fronto-central and central regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict detection, was found across both groups, although patients presented a reduced N450 relative to healthy controls. By contrast, the amplitude of the sustained potential (SP) (600-800 ms) over the parieto-central and parietal regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict resolution, was significantly increased in patients relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, such increased SP amplitude correlated positively with improved behavioral accuracy in symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia. These findings reveal that symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia increasingly recruited the parietal activity involving successful conflict resolution to offset reduced conflict detection. Therefore, this provides further insight into compensatory mechanisms potentially involving a degree of functional recovery of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission.

54,"A Summary This manuscript describes the role of low vitamin D in bone metabolism of Klinefelter subjects. Low vitamin D is frequent in this condition and seems to be more important than testosterone in inducing low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. Supplementation with vitamin D restores BMD after 2 years of treatment, whereas testosterone alone seems to be ineffective. Introduction Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is frequent, and it has been traditionally related to low testosterone (T) levels. However, low BMD can be observed also in patients with normal T levels and T replacement therapy does not necessarily increase bone mass in these patients. Nothing is known about vitamin D levels and supplementation in KS. In this study, we determine vitamin D status and bone mass in KS subjects and compare the efficacy of T therapy and vitamin D supplementation on BMD. Methods A total of 127 non-mosaic KS patients and 60 age-matched male controls were evaluated with reproductive hormones, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, and bone densitometry by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Patients with hypogonadism and/or 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency were treated with T-gel 2 % and/or calcifediol and re-evaluated after 24 months of treatment. Results 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower in KS patients with respect to controls, and they had significantly lower lumbar and femoral BMD. The percentage of osteopenia/osteoporosis in subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was higher with respect to subjects with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D and was not related to the presence/absence of low T levels. Subjects treated with calcifediol or T + calcifediol had a significant increase in lumbar BMD after treatment. No difference was found in T-treated group. Conclusion These data highlight that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels seem to have a more critical role than low T levels in inducing low BMD in KS subjects. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation seems to be more effective than T replacement therapy alone in increasing BMD.

55,"Accumulating evidence indicates that a small subset of cancer cells, termed the tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs), construct a reservoir of self-sustaining cancer cells with the characteristic ability to self-renew and maintain the tumor mass. The CSCs play an important role in the tumor initiation, development, relapse, metastasis, and the ineffectiveness of conventional cancer therapies. CD47 is a ligand for signal-regulatory protein-alpha expressed on phagocytic cells and functions to inhibit phagocytosis. This study was to explore if the expression of CD47 is the mechanism used by lung cancer cells, especially CSCs, to escape phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we selected CD133 as the marker for lung CSCs according to previous reports. We analyzed lung cancer and matched adjacent normal (non-tumor) tissue and revealed that CD47 is overexpressed on lung cancer cells, especially on lung CSCs. The mRNA expression levels of CD47 and CD133 correlated with a decreased probability of survival for multiple types of lung cancer. Blocking CD47 function with anti-CD47 antibodies enabled macrophage phagocytosis of lung cancer cells and lung CSCs. Anti-CD47 antibodies inhibited tumor growth in immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation models established with lung cancer cells or lung CSCs and improved survival in tumor-bearing animals. These data indicate that CD47 is a valid target for cancer therapies, especially for anti-CSC therapies.

It illustrates critical information necessary to identify potential weaknesses and areas for enhanced defense. Attack graphs include multiple attack paths, which are a focus for further detailed analysis and risk mitigation.

The proposed algorithm does not require generation of the full attack graph to calculate the K attack paths. Instead, it directly processes and analyzes the system input data and dynamically identifies the K attack paths. The computational time, based upon the complexity of the attack paths, can be constrained by the parameter K. Experimental results show that the algorithm is scalable and efficient.

The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time scales were forecasted with 1-6-month lead times at 0.05 x 0.05 degrees resolution. The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer's accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user's accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mechanisms involved with recovery from AKI are poorly understood and molecular mediators responsible for healing and restoration of kidney function are understudied. We previously discovered differential expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) mRNA and protein in patients with severe sepsis associated AKI versus sepsis without AKI. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of MMP-8 in purely ischemic AKI. Mice subjected to 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia developed increased plasma creatinine and MMP-8 expression within 24 h versus sham controls. After an initial surge and subsequent return toward baseline, both kidney MMP-8 expression and activity exhibited a late increase (Days 5-7 post-ischemia reperfusion) in mice subjected to AKI. Neutrophil infiltration of the kidney was significantly higher after AKI in wild-type mice than in MMP-8 null mice, starting at 4 days. Additionally, MMP-8 null mice subjected to AKI demonstrated a persistent histopathologic and functional injury and worsened health (greater overall weight loss) versus wild-type cohorts after seven days. Taken together, our findings suggest that MMP-8 is involved with restoration of baseline kidney health after ischemic kidney injury and that a potential mechanism involves the interaction of MMP-8 and neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury.

66,"A new framework of electromagnetic theory is presented on the basis of conservation principles of energy and momentum. First, Maxwell's equations and Lorentz force law in vacuum are derived as theorems from the conservation principles. Next, new kinds of averaging procedure, transversal and longitudinal, are introduced to deal with the macroscopic media. Electromagnetic field (E, H) and flux density (D, B) are defined as the longitudinal and transversal averages of the corresponding microscopic field. The polarization P and magnetization M defined as P = D-epsilon(0) E, M = B-mu(0) H are given explicit expressions in terms of microscopic electromagnetic structure of the matter. Lorentz transformation of space-time and electromagnetic field can be derived entirely within the framework of electromagnetic theory.

Their optimal use in advanced military applications drives much of their basic innovative research and development, especially when new needs arise in the rapidly changing domains of stealth-agile, fighter aircraft and tailless-stealth, Jet-Steered, Unmanned Air Vehicles (JS-UAV). For these reasons we periodically update this Journal with new trends that affect, and sometimes control, research and development of future jet-engines. One relevant example is the recently unmasked RQ-180 stealth-tailless drone, which is an improved version of the smaller, RQ-170 captured by Iran. Most important, with the new X-47B/C tailless-stealth JS-UAV, it is to dominate future uses of fuel-efficient jet-engines, especially for operating in dusty environments. The RQ-180 has been secretly designed and funded since 2008. It is based on a classified, 1986, parent Israeli Patents 78402, which protect hundreds design and testing trade secrets taken from 1986 to 1997 by the United States Government (USG) via classified contracts with USG-Contractors Boeing, Lockheed, General Dynamics and General Electric, as revealed by a December 6, 2013 Aviation Week [1-3] and U.

68,"A real-time cooperative communication based wireless network is presented for monitoring health and activity of an end-user in their environment. The cooperative communication offers better energy consumption and also an opportunity to aware the current location of a user non-intrusively. The link between mobile sensor node and relay node is dynamically established by using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) based on adaptive relay selection scheme. The study proposes a Linear Acceleration based Transmission Power Decision Control (LA-TPDC) algorithm to further enhance the energy efficiency of cooperative communication. Further, the occurrences of false alarms are carefully prevented by introducing three stages of sequential warning system. The real-time experiments are carried-out by using the nodes, namely mobile sensor node, relay nodes and a destination node which are indigenously developed by using a CC430 microcontroller integrated with an in-built transceiver at 868 MHz. The wireless node performance characteristics, such as energy consumption, SignalNoise ratio (SNR), Bit Error Rate (BER), Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and transmission offset are evaluated for all the participated nodes. The experimental results observed that the proposed linear acceleration based transmission power decision control algorithm almost doubles the battery life time than energy efficient conventional cooperative communication.

70,"A long-standing belief is that sign language interferes with spoken language development in deaf children, despite a chronic lack of evidence supporting this belief. This deserves discussion as poor life outcomes continue to be seen in the deaf population. This commentary synthesizes research outcomes with signing and non-signing children and highlights fully accessible language as a protective factor for healthy development. Brain changes associated with language deprivation may be misrepresented as sign language interfering with spoken language outcomes of cochlear implants. This may lead to professionals and organizations advocating for preventing sign language exposure before implantation and spreading misinformation. The existence of one-time-sensitive-language acquisition window means a strong possibility of permanent brain changes when spoken language is not fully accessible to the deaf child and sign language exposure is delayed, as is often standard practice. There is no empirical evidence for the harm of sign language exposure but there is some evidence for its benefits, and there is growing evidence that lack of language access has negative implications. This includes cognitive delays, mental health difficulties, lower quality of life, higher trauma, and limited health literacy. Claims of cochlear implant- and spoken language-only approaches being more effective than sign language-inclusive approaches are not empirically supported. Cochlear implants are an unreliable standalone first-language intervention for deaf children. Priorities of deaf child development should focus on healthy growth of all developmental domains through a fully-accessible first language foundation such as sign language, rather than auditory deprivation and speech skills.

Considerable research, simulations, and experiments have been conducted on HVAC control. The optimization control of an HVAC system is now the popular issue. The ultimate goal of this paper was to achieve minimum energy consumption and improve system efficiency. Multi-zone variable air volume and variable water volume air-conditioning systems were developed. The dynamic models of HVAC sub-systems were built by the adaptive directional forgetting method. Control strategies such as the gearshift integral proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and self-tuning PID controller were studied in the platform to improve the dynamic characteristics of the HVAC system. System performance was improved. The system saved 18.2% of energy with the integration of iterative learning control and sequential quadratic programming based on the steady-state hierarchical optimization control scheme.

72,"Age-associated changes in cardiac structure and function, together with estrogen loss, contribute to the progression of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in older women. To investigate the effects of aging and estrogen loss on the development of its precursor, asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, echocardiograms were performed in 10 middle-aged (20 months) and 30 old-aged (30 months) female Fischer344xBrown-Norway rats, 4 and 8 weeks after ovariectomy (OVX) and sham procedures (gonads left intact). The cardioprotective potential of administering chronic G1, the selective agonist to the new G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), was further evaluated in old rats (Old-OVX+G1) versus age-matched, vehicle-treated OVX and gonadal intact rats. Advanced age and estrogen loss led to decreases in myocardial relaxation and elevations in filling pressure, in part, due to reductions in phosphorylated phospholamban and increases in cardiac collagen deposition. Eight weeks of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor activation in Old-OVX+G1 rats reversed the adverse effects of age and estrogen loss on myocardial relaxation through increases in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase expression and reductions in interstitial fibrosis. These findings may explain the preponderance of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in older postmenopausal women and provide a promising, late-life therapeutic target to reverse or halt the progression of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

73,"A chitin-based polyurethane (TRCPU) organogel composed of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and chitin is shown to undergo a temperature-dependent sal-to-gel transition in polar organic solvents. The soft segments of the prepolymer that originated from the PEG imparted elastomeric and hydrophilic characteristics to the TRCPUs. The hard segments of chitin and IPDI that contained highly polar urethane linkages acted as physical alignment sites and provided lipophilic characteristics for the TRCPUs in the polar organic solvent. The average molecular weight and the degree of acetylation of chitin were determined based on the intrinsic viscosity and solid-state C-13-CP/MAS NMR spectrum. Chitin was incorporated into polyurethane via covalent bonding; the resultant copolymer was an injectable organosol at low temperatures that transformed to a semisolid organogel at approximately 105 degrees C. The TRCPUs were characterized by H-1 NMR, FT-IR and DSC, and the theological behavior of the TRCPU solutions in organic solvents was studied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

74,"Adaptive and intelligent instructional systems are used to deal with the issue of learning personalisation in contexts where human instructors are not immediately available, so their role is transferred entirely or in part onto the computer. Even though such systems are mostly developed for well-defined domains that have a rather straightforward acquisition order, such as mathematics or computer programming, they found their application in ill-defined domains as well. Natural language learning is one such domain, and developing adaptive instructional systems for this specific purpose is notoriously complex and challenging due to the nature of language systems. The paper at hand examines the theoretical background of adaptivity and intelligence in instructional systems, and discusses their application in learning and teaching of natural languages. Moreover, the paper reviews adaptive and intelligent language learning systems in existence and identifies their characteristics in a systematic manner. The discussion section offers a more detailed view of selected systems for language learning that exhibit interesting and innovative implementation solutions. The paper concludes by suggesting possible developmental directions and future work in the field.

75,"Aim: The campos rupestres are species-rich tropical mountain grasslands in southeast Brazil that are threatened by mining and quarrying. Eight years following a strong disturbance (i.e. quarrying for gravel exploitation during the asphalting of highway MG-010), spontaneous succession did not occur on degraded areas. This study was therefore designed to test the restoration technique of hay transfer as a means of enhancing seed dispersal from the reference ecosystems to the degraded areas. Location: Campo rupestre grasslands, Serra do Cipo, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods: Nine degraded areas representing three kinds of substrate (latosol, sandy and stony) were selected. Hay transfer was carried out using hay collected in two kinds of grassland (i.e. campos arenosos and campos pedregosos) year-round in 2010, in order to maximize the seed pool. The collected hay was distributed on 40 cm x 40 cm quadrats among the three types of substrate, with and without geotextile, according to the following protocol: hay from campo arenoso grasslands was spread on all types of substrate, while hay from campo pedregoso grasslands was used on stony substrate only. Results: Few seedlings emerged within 14 mo of the treatment application, despite the large number of seeds contained in the hay, indicating that hay transfer may not be a useful method for restoring degraded areas of campos rupestres. The seedlings emerging on the degraded areas mainly belonged to ruderal species. Therefore, we suggest that, although poor soil conditions could limit seedling establishment, germination issues of the campo rupestre species are the first limitation for restoring degraded campos rupestres using hay transfer. Conclusion: Our results highlight the inherent difficulty in restoring degraded areas of campos rupestres; their protection must be made a high conservation priority.

76,"A water and an acetone extract of the Icelandic brown algae Fucus vesiculosus were evaluated as potential natural sources of antioxidant compounds in skin care emulsions. To assess their efficacy in inhibiting lipid oxidation caused by photo- or thermoxidation, they were stored in darkness and room temperature as control conditions, and compared to samples stored under accelerated conditions (light and room temperature, or darkness and 40 degrees C). The presence of extracts in the skin care emulsions induced remarkable colour changes when the emulsions were exposed to light, and more extensively under high temperature. High temperature also caused greater increments in the droplet size of the emulsions. The analysis of the tocopherol content, peroxide value and volatile compounds during the storage revealed that, whereas both water and acetone extracts showed (at 2mg/g of emulsion) protective effect against thermooxidation, only the water extract showed antioxidant activity against photooxidation. Practical applications: This research is the basis of developing natural antioxidants derived from seaweed to limit lipid oxidation in skin care products.

All HIV-infected patients with a diagnosis of cancer between 2000 and 2011 in an urban clinic population in Baltimore, MD, were included for review. HIV-related outcomes (HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 cell count) were abstracted and compared for patients with non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) and AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs). Four hundred twelve patients with baseline CD4 or HIV-1 RNA viral load data were analyzed. There were 122 (30%) diagnoses of ADCs and 290 (70%) NADCs. Patients with NADCs had a higher median age (54 years vs. 43 years, p < .0001) and a higher frequency of hepatitis C coinfection (52% vs. 36%, p = .002). The median baseline CD4 was lower for patients with ADCs (137 cells/mm 3 vs. 314 cells/mm 3) and patients with NADCs were more likely to be suppressed at cancer diagnosis (59% vs. 25%) (both p < .0001). The median CD4 for patients with NADCs was significantly higher than patients with ADCs at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and higher at 18 and 24 months, but not significantly. Patients with an NADC had 2.19 times (95% CI 1.04-4.62) the adjusted odds of being suppressed at 12 months and 2.17 times the odds (95% CI 0.92-5.16) at 24 months compared to patients with an ADC diagnosis. For patients diagnosed with ADCs and NADCs in this urban clinic setting, both virologic suppression and immunologic recovery improved over time. Patients with NADCs had the highest odds of virologic suppression in the 2 years following cancer diagnosis.

Apart from being important players in the regulation of cells of the immune system, T cells are essential for normal brain development. We here report studies on the relationship between circulating levels of T helper cells and structural and functional brain imaging in depressed bipolar patients. Since the CCL20-CCR6 axis is an important entry to the brain we differentiated the various T helper cell subpopulations on the basis of their chemokine receptor expression. Methods: FACS staining was performed for Th1,Th2,Th17, Th22 and T regulatory cells on frozen leukocytes of 25 consecutively admitted inpatients affected by a major depressive episode, without psychotic features, in the course of Bipolar Disorder I and 21 healthy controls. The frequency of the T helper populations was associated with DTI and fMRI data acquired on a Philips 3.0 Tesla scanner. Tract based spatial statistic was used to obtain measures of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, axial, radial and mean diffusivity) from a standard DTI sequence with 35 directions. Patients were also studied for fMRI through a moral valence decision task were subjects had to decide whether morally tuned stimuli were positive or negative. Results: The percentage of circulating Th17 (CCR6(+)CXCR3(neg)CCR4(+)CCR10(neg)) cells correlated positively with higher fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts contributing to the functional integrity of the brain both in patients and healthy controls, while the frequency of circulating T regulatory (CD(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) cells correlated positively with higher radial and mean diffusivity in patients. The frequency of circulating T regulatory cells also correlated to lower neuronal responses to negative versus positive morally tuned stimuli in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients. Thl cells correlated negatively with white matter integrity in several tracts (healthy controls), while the cells showed a positive correlation to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (patients). Conclusion: This study shows a new putative role for Th17 cells. Th17 cells are not only playing a role in inducing autoimmunity and auto-inflammation, but might also play a counter intuitive anabolic role in the maintenance of the functional and structural integrity of the brain.

[Subjects] The subjects were 51 athletes from Unicaja athletic club who trained regularly. [Methods] At the end of the preseason and volume periods, athletes were subjected to bipodal and monopodal stabilometry. In addition, all injuries happening in the periods after performing stabilometry (volume and pre-competition periods) were tracked. [Results] Variance analysis of bipodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the preseason period showed that athletes with higher values for the center-of-pressure spread variables suffered injuries during the volume period. The right-leg monopodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the volume period showed that athletes with higher values in the center-of-pressure position variables suffered injuries during the pre-competition period. [Conclusion] Athletes showing the worst values for center-of-pressure spread variables are more prone to sports injuries in the subsequent training period. In monopodal measurements, athletes with poorer mediolateral stability were more prone to injuries in the subsequent training period.

Aging contributes to common processes including metabolic dysfunction, DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species generation. Although glycolysis has been linked to cell growth and proliferation, the mechanisms by which the activation of glycolysis by aging regulates fibrogenesis in the lung remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine if glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-induced glycolysis regulates age-dependent fibrogenesis of the lung. Mouse and human lung tissues were analyzed for GLUT1 and glycolytic markers using immunoblotting. Glycolytic function was measured using a Seahorse apparatus. To study the effect of GLUT1, genetic inhibition of GLUT1 was performed by short hairpin RNA transduction, and phloretin was used for pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1. GLUT1-dependent glycolysis is activated in aged lung. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1 suppressed the protein expression of a-smooth muscle actin, a key cytoskeletal component of activated fibroblasts, in mouse primary lung fibroblast cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the activation of AMP activated protein kinase, which is regulated by GLUT1-dependent glycolysis, represents a critical metabolic pathway for fibroblast activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phloretin, a potent inhibitor of GLUT1, significantly inhibited bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo. These results suggest that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis regulates fibrogenesis in aged lung and that inhibition of GLUT1 provides a potential target of therapy of age-related lung fibrosis.

We aimed to describe groups of patients with COPD according to patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour following PR. 90 patients with COPD (60% male; mean age 67 +/- 8; median FEV1 47 (32-62) % pred) completed a comprehensive PR programme. A triaxial accelerometer was used to assess the time in sedentary behaviour, light activities and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Additionally, exercise capacity, quality of life, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed before and after PR. Six groups with different patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour were identified. The two most prevalent patterns were represented by good responders (increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary behaviour, 34%) and poor responders (decrease in physical activity and increase in sedentary behaviour, 30%). Good responders had greater improvements in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and symptoms of depression than poor responders (P < 0.05 for all). Strong correlation was found between changes in sedentary behaviour and changes in light activities (r(s) = -0.89; P < 0.0001). Changes in 6MWD correlated fairly with changes in sedentary behaviour (r(s) = -0.26), light activities (r(s) = 0.25), and MVPA (r(s) = 0.24); P < 0.05 for all. Different patterns of change in activity levels following PR can be found in patients with COPD. Focusing on light physical activities might be a potential strategy to make patients less sedentary, but for this to be achieved prior (or at least parallel) improvements in functional capacity seem to be necessary.

Geographic routing (or position-based routing) has become an attractive solution for such networks since it reduces routing control overhead flooded in the network to construct routes (routes discovery). Many geographic routing protocols have been designed to guarantee packet delivery in such networks. However, these protocols consider that all nodes in the network are trustworthy which allows malicious nodes to violate network security and disrupt packet forwarding. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new security approach that secures geographic routing protocols against a variety of attacks. Our approach is based on the use of MACs to allow intermediate nodes to verify the authenticity and the integrity of forwarded packets and uses authenticated acknowledgements to prevent packet dropping attacks. To meet node's resource constraints, we have based our solution on symmetric cryptography. Our solution is robust against modification and dropping attacks even in the presence of compromised nodes in the network.

AmI proposes the development of context aware systems equipped with devices that can recognize your context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. However, current agent approaches do not adequately fulfill the requirements posed by AmI systems. From a modeling point of view, the aim should be to help in the design by providing adequate tools that assist in the development of important properties of AmI systems, such as context-awareness; and from an implementation point of view, agent technologies must be adapted to the diversity of AmI devices and communication technologies. As a solution to these issues we propose a Model driven engineering process, which supports the automatic generation of agent-based AmI systems. The source metamodel is PIM4Agents, a general purpose agent metamodel that we have adapted to support the explicit modeling of context aware systems, and the target metamodel is Malaca, an aspect-oriented agent architecture. Aspect-orientation makes Malaca platform-neutral for FIPA compliant agent platforms, simplifying the model driven process. The solution generates MalacaTiny agents, an implementation of Malaca that is able to run in AmI devices. We have evaluated the convenience of applying a model driven approach by measuring the degree of automation of our process and we have evaluated MalacaTiny for mobile phones by assessing different parameters, related to the scarcity of resources in AmI systems.

91,"A high-efficiency, high-power-density buffer architecture is proposed for power pulsation decoupling in power conversion between dc and single-phase ac. We present an active decoupling solution that yields improved efficiency and reduced circuit complexity compared to existing solutions. In the proposed architecture, the main energy storage capacitor is connected in series with an active buffer converter across the dc bus. The series-stacked capacitor blocks the majority of the dc bus voltage to reduce the voltage stress on the buffer converter, such that fast, low-voltage transistors can be employed for the buffer converter. Moreover, the series capacitor provides the majority of the power pulsation decoupling through a wide voltage swing, and the buffer converter only needs to process a small fraction of the total power of the entire architecture, allowing a very small active circuit volume and very high system efficiency. The circuit operation and design constraints are analyzed in detail. In the proposed buffer architecture, the series stacking of a nearly lossless capacitor and a lossy converter presents a challenge of capacitor voltage balancing and power loss compensation. We propose a control scheme exploiting the small ripple in the bus voltage and dc input current to compensate for the power loss in the buffer converter while maintaining the voltage balance. Light-load techniques are also introduced to ensure that the buffer architecture meets strict ripple requirements while providing sufficient loss compensation. A 2-kW hardware prototype based on low-voltage GaN switches has been built to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution.

Based on the conventional LQR method, the proposed controller is designed and makes the following two improvements. First, in order to eliminate the phase error caused by right-half-phase zero emerged in non-minimum phase boost converter, a feedforward controller is implemented by zero phase error tracking control technique because the inverse of non-minimum phase system is unstable. Second, since the models of DC-DC converter in CCM or DCM are different, the proposed control strategy allows boost converter to autonomously operate in CCM or DCM controller by utilising a mode detector. The proposed mode detector greatly enhances the control performance in both operating modes. Finally, the proposed controller has been implemented for voltage control of a boost converter.

94,"A necessary condition for stability of a class of recurrent type-2 TSK fuzzy systems is presented. In this system, the antecedent part is indeed represented by interval Gaussian type-2 fuzzy set, and the consequent part is an ordinary nonlinear function of the system's inputs. In the proposed method, at first a type-2 fuzzy model is established, and then an LMI-based stability analysis of the model is fully discussed. Two first-order systems (one stable and one unstable) and two second-order systems (one stable and one unstable) are then considered as proper case studies. The simulation results easily approve the effectiveness of the proposed method.

95,"A Software Product Line is a set of software systems of a domain, which share some common features but also have significant variability. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact which represents differences among software products with respect to variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by selecting features in the feature model (referred to as the configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. However, feature model configuration can be a cumbersome task because: 1) feature models may consist of a large number of features, which are hard to comprehend and maintain; and 2) many factors including technical limitations, implementation costs, stakeholders' requirements and expectations must be considered in the configuration process. Recognizing these issues, a significant amount of research efforts has been dedicated to different aspects of feature model configuration such as automating the configuration process. Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the feature model configuration challenges through applying visualization and interaction techniques. However, there have been limited empirical insights available into the impact of visualization and interaction techniques on the feature model configuration process. In this paper, we present a set of visualization and interaction interventions for representing and configuring feature models, which are then empirically validated to measure the impact of the proposed interventions. An empirical study was conducted by following the principles of control experiments in software engineering and by applying the well-known software quality standard ISO 9126 to operationalize the variables investigated in the experiment. The results of the empirical study revealed that the employed visualization and interaction interventions significantly improved completion time of comprehension and changing of the feature model configuration. Additionally, according to results, the proposed interventions are easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for the participants.

96,"A novel magnetic force driven noncontact electromagnetic-triboelectric hybrid nanogenerator for scavenging biomechanical energy to sustainably power portable electrics is presented. Based on the effective conjunction of electromagnetic induction and triboelectrification, the hybrid nanogenerator with a small dimension consists of an electromagnetic generator (EMG) with a peak output power of 3.4 mW under a load resistance of 200 Omega and a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a peak output power of 0.23 mW under a load resistance of 25 M Omega. For TENG, the electrospun Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded PVDF fibers membrane is employed as triboelectric layer. A magnet is utilized as the trigger to non-contactly drive contact-separation mode TENG due to the magnetic responsiveness of triboelectric materials, and the EMG can be drived by coupling magnet with copper coils simultaneously. The hybrid nanogenerator exhibits a good stability for the output performance and charging performance, so it can be utilized to charge energy storage devices and sustainably power some portable electronics. This work demonstrates a novel prototype of hybrid nanogenerators toward harvesting human biomechanical energy and its potential applications in building up self-powered systems.

97,"A family of conservative, truly nonlinear, oscillators with integer or non-integer order nonlinearity is considered. These oscillators have only one odd power-form elastic-term and exact expressions for their period and solution were found in terms of Gamma functions and a cosine-Ateb function, respectively. Only for a few values of the order of nonlinearity, is it possible to obtain the periodic solution in terms of more common functions. However, for this family of conservative truly nonlinear oscillators we show in this paper that it is possible to obtain the Fourier series expansion of the exact solution, even though this exact solution is unknown. The coefficients of the Fourier series expansion of the exact solution are obtained as an integral expression in which a regularized incomplete Beta function appears. These coefficients are a function of the order of nonlinearity only and are computed numerically. One application of this technique is to compare the amplitudes for the different harmonics of the solution obtained using approximate methods with the exact ones computed numerically as shown in this paper. As an example, the approximate amplitudes obtained via a modified Ritz method are compared with the exact ones computed numerically. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

99,"A common feature of ambient intelligence is that many objects are inter-connected and act in unison, which is also a challenge in the Internet of Things. There has been a shift in research towards integrating both concepts, considering the Internet of Things as representing the future of computing and communications. However, the efficient combination and management of heterogeneous things or devices in the ambient intelligence domain is still a tedious task, and it presents crucial challenges. Therefore, to appropriately manage the inter-connection of diverse devices in these systems requires: (1) specifying and efficiently implementing the devices (e.g., as services); (2) handling and verifying their heterogeneity and composition; and (3) standardizing and managing their data, so as to tackle large numbers of systems together, avoiding standalone applications on local servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a platform to manage the integration and behavior-aware orchestration of heterogeneous devices as services, stored and accessed via the cloud, with the following contributions: (i) we describe a lightweight model to specify the behavior of devices, to determine the order of the sequence of exchanged messages during the composition of devices; (ii) we define a common architecture using a service-oriented standard environment, to integrate heterogeneous devices by means of their interfaces, via a gateway, and to orchestrate them according to their behavior; (iii) we design a framework based on cloud computing technology, connecting the gateway in charge of acquiring the data from the devices with a cloud platform, to remotely access and monitor the data at run-time and react to emergency situations; and (iv) we implement and generate a novel cloud-based IoT platform of behavior-aware devices as services for ambient intelligence systems, validating the whole approach in real scenarios related to a specific ambient assisted living application.

100,"A nonrelational, distributed computing, data warehouse, and analytics environment (Energy-CRADLE) was developed for the analysis of field and laboratory data from multiple heterogeneous photovoltaic (PV) test sites. This data informatics and analytics infrastructure was designed to process diverse formats of PV performance data and climatic telemetry time-series data collected from a PV outdoor test network, i.e., the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension global SunFarm network, as well as point-in-time laboratory spectral and image measurements of PV material samples. Using Hadoop/HBase for the distributed data warehouse, Energy-CRADLE does not have a predefined data table schema, which enables ingestion of data in diverse and changing formats. For easy data ingestion and data retrieval, Energy-CRADLE utilizes Hadoop streaming to enable Python MapReduce and provides a graphical user interface, i.e., py-CRADLE. By developing the Hadoop distributed computing platform and the HBase NoSQL database schema for solar energy, Energy-CRADLE exemplifies an integrated, scalable, secure, and user-friendly data informatics and analytics system for PV researchers.

Dielectric elastomer, a lightweight, high elastic energy density and large deformation under high DC/AC voltages smart material, was used to fabricate this new generation actuator. The acoustic performances of this duct silencer were experimentally investigated in a transmission loss (TL) measurement system using two-load method. It was found that the resonance peaks of this new duct silencer could be controlled by applying various DC voltages, a maximum resonance shift of 59.5Hz for the resonance peaks was achieved which indicated that this duct silencer could be adjusted to absorb broadband range noise without any addition mechanical part. Furthermore, the resonance shift and multiple resonances mechanisms using DEAs were proposed and discussed in the present paper which was aiming to achieve broadband noise reduction. The present results also provide insight into the appropriateness of the absorber for possible use as new acoustic treatment to replace the traditional acoustic treatment.

104,"A novel method for monitoring parameters of absorbing coatings, which are widely used for stealth technology, is described in this paper. The offered method of measurements is based on the use of slow-wave structures (SWSs), which electrodynamic parameters strongly depend on the electromagnetic properties of the absorbing coatings. The main advantages of the SWS-based measurements are in the possibility to concentrate electromagnetic field in a volume with linear dimensions much smaller the wavelength in free space and to split electric and magnetic fields, providing practically independent monitoring of dielectric and magnetic properties of the coatings. Resonant frequencies and Q-factor of a SWS section placed in parallel to a monitored coating can be used as primary measuring parameters. Analysis of the dispersion equation derived for a SWS-based sensitive element in the presence of a coating allows creating algorithms for converting measured electrodynamic parameters into the reading of the coatings' electromagnetic properties. It is shown also that the use of coupled SWSs leads to the increase in the informative parameters' number and to the significant increase in sensitivity.

105,"All-to-all personalized exchange (ATAPE) is an inspired process to speedup the parallel and distributed computing. Recently, ATAPE algorithms were successfully applied on multistage interconnection networks (MINs), including baseline and butterfly networks. However, routing of those algorithms on MINs relies on switch-patterns for stage-control from sources (S), which is a half-routing solution since they cannot perform a full self-routing with the (S, D) protocol for all MINs. In this paper, first we propose a full-routing solution of the realizing ATAPE on a class of d-nary-switch MINs(+) (i.e., baseline(+), butterfly(+), etc.). Our ATAPE can be embedded on-chip effectively for not only (S, D) self-routing but also stage-/switch-control routing. Two embedded ATAPE functions incorporate with multi-stage pipelining are proposed in optimal O(N + log(2) N): 1. a (default) static function D = S XOR (C + order) mod N and 2. an (optional) f-in-1 dynamic function D = rho [(S + C + order) mod N] with the incrementing counter C = 0 to N - 1. Second, we introduce a crossbar of MINs(+) with fewer delay-stages to achieve the ultimate ATAPE embedding. Finally, experimental results of applying ATAPE on such MINs(+) are confirmed fruitfully, including the ATAPE-based NxN-matrix transposition in O(N + log(2) N), which yields the significant speedup.

Menopausal hot flushes have a complex relationship to different features of the metabolic syndrome and not all data point towards an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic syndrome.

The role of buildings is reframed to consider what capabilities for sustainability a building can provide to the inhabitants and local community.

This approach has clear implications about the role of buildings in enabling residents and users to achieve these targets and outcomes. This shifts the focus of net-positive development toward configurations and characteristics of the built environment that are appropriate for a particular context. A Built Environment Sustainability Tool (BEST) is presented that defines and assesses these configurations and characteristics. Assessments can be conducted by measuring the extent to which required configurations and characteristics exist (i.e. 'the capability of the built environment to support sustainability').

The present addendum resolves inconsistencies in outcome reporting (e.g., total scores of scales versus subscale scores) and provides information on measures that were additionally available to analyze further potential effects of the intervention. Effects in secondary outcome domains not reported in Heinrichs et al. (2014) are furthermore analyzed and reported. The original data analyses were varied using a different statistical model in this addendum. Re-analyses supported the original results, including changes in self-reported maternal and paternal positive parenting, in maternal dysfunctional parenting behavior as well as in maternal reports of child behavior. In addition, when analyzing the externalizing and internalizing dimensions, analysis revealed a statistically significant change in externalizing but not internalizing child symptoms. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcome domains. Considering important limitations in the study design [such as baseline differences at pre-assessment with mothers from intervention preschools reporting more child behavioral problems prior to introducing the intervention and predominantly non-significant effects from (a) fathers perspective, (b) teacher ratings at 1-year follow up (FU1), and (c) behavioral observations at FU1], we believe that this trial alone cannot be taken as sufficient evidence for a significant and meaningful change in child behavioral problems, which is the ultimate goal of child prevention programs. Therefore, future studies need to replicate and extend upon these results by including larger sample sizes and overcome the discussed limitations.

116,"Adding the number of computing nodes is a common approach to achieving higher performance in a parallel computing system. However, with constraint of fixed system architecture and fixed algorithm structure, it is difficult to improve the performance of parallel computing only by extending its scale absolutely. To realize such extension with fixed structure, we analyze key factors from architecture and parallel task, which affect the scalability, and then use the weighted graph to model architecture as well as parallel task. Especially, focusing on the case that architecture graph and parallel task graph are homogeneous, we propose the extension method of graph similarity; for the case that architecture graph and parallel task graph are heterogeneous, a critical-path-unchanged scaling method is proposed. Actually, the above two extending methods do not change the graph's structure. They only adjust the node weight and edge-weight in the relevant graph. Furthermore, through mathematical derivation, some conclusions about the new scaling methods are drawn. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness, some simulative experiments are conducted on the platform SimGrid. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can realize iso-speed-efficiency extension, and can guide practical extensions for parallel computing.

At the age of 17 months he had been referred to the pediatric endocrinologist because of polyuria and polydipsia in order to exclude diabetes insipidus. Repeated water deprivation tests and a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain were normal. Diabetes insipidus was excluded, and primary polydipsia was thought to be most likely since diabetes mellitus also had been excluded. At the current presentation, he drank up to 3 L a day and quite often had wet diapers. He also seemed to pass stools infrequently and with difficulty. Curiously his grandmother had similar symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia since childhood and had been diagnosed with primary polydipsia. The physical examination of our pediatric patient was normal. In the differential diagnosis we included diabetes insipidus but also contemplated other possibilities, such as nephronophthisis, tubulopathies and hypercalciuria. Laboratory results including urinalysis and an ultrasound of the kidney did not show any abnormalities, making a tubulopathy or hypercalciuria unlikely. A desmopressin test by the intravenous route came back completely normal, pointing to another cause than diabetes insipidus. Genetic testing for the nephronophthisis came back negative but was positive for a missense mutation in the AVPR2 gene (p.Arg104Cys) associated with partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. He was started on daily desmopressin. Within 3 days the urinary incontinence resolved as did the polyuria and faecal incontinence. His grandmother was referred to the geneticist and eventually the adult nephrologist. This case highlights the importance of being thorough when confronted with a difficult diagnosis. It also emphasizes that a test result does not necessarily equate to the presence or absence of a condition since the test with 100 % sensitivity and specificity has yet to be discovered.

122,"Aggregate makes up a high mass fraction in asphalt pavements. The morphological characteristics of aggregate (i.e., shape factors, angularity, and surface texture) significantly affect the mechanical performance of asphalt pavement. Extensive investigations of aggregate morphology have been conducted on coarse aggregate in recent years; however the analysis of fine aggregate has not been carried out up to date. Commonly used methods to extrapolate information on the morphology of fine aggregate such as sand flow test (SFT) and Uncompacted Void Content Test (UVCT) give a general characterization of the aggregate morphology without allowing for differentiated conclusions regarding the respective morphological factors. In this study digital image processing (DIP) is used to determine morphological index values of fine aggregate. Data from DIP is compared with results from UVCT and SFT by means of correlation analyses to investigate the applicability and precision of the respective methods. UVCT and SFT are found to be strongly reliable on the absolute grain size rendering the methods less resilient. DIP is very well suited to determine specific morphological indices of fine aggregates and is a useful tool for the design of asphalt mixtures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compared with previously published stimulators, this design has advantages of large stimulated current (0-0.8 mA) with the double low-voltage supply (1.8 and 3.3 V), and high-level integration.

The leapfrog alternating direction implicit FDTD (ADI-FDTD) method is employed to eliminate the restriction of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. The proposed domain decomposition parallel implementation of the leapfrog ADI-FDTD method is more flexible with process allocation and requires fewer data communications. A buffer region is introduced to decouple the interactions between neighboring subdomains at each time step. Electromagnetic simulations are presented to demonstrate the applicability, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.

130,"A lightweight model predictive controller for a class of discrete event systems is developed. The target is first in first out (FIFO) systems, in which the precedence relations are represented by a directed acyclic graph. Using max-plus algebra, a system's behavior can be described by a set of linear equations referred to as the state space representation. Using this representation, we address the problem of adjusting system parameters and determining optimal control inputs for given reference signals. To determine system parameters, we formulate and solve an optimization problem using a branch-and-bound method, by which the number of constraints is reduced. Then, the optimal control inputs are determined. Since this part is often the bottleneck in online control, we propose two methods for the efficient computation thereof. The first method is beneficial for systems with sparse adjacency matrices and small-scale systems with a greater prediction horizon. In contrast, the second approach is beneficial for larger-scale systems with a smaller prediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified through numerical simulations.

131,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) could be a precious opportunity for patients to reveal concealed diseases other than conventional risk factors for ACS, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, etc. In the setting of ACS, the intracoronary and systemic prothrombotic environment has led to an increase in the risk of stent thrombosis of which mortality was higher among patients with ACS, especially with the highest mortality in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction. The some specific conditions which were concealed beyond the cardiovascular pathophysiology except well-known risk factors for ACS and stent thrombosis might involve the onset of ACS. We describe a case of a 64-year-old man who was admitted to intensive care unit for chest pain. This case found the possibility that polycythemia vera with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation might be a underlying disease of ACS with stent thrombosis, and highlighted the importance of recognizing polycythemia vera with JAK2 V617F mutation as concealed disease for cardiologists.

133,"An ""edaphic-landscape"" restoration was performed in two anthracite coal mine spoil heaps located in NW Spain as a demonstration and pilot program for the restoration of coal mine spoils. Terrestrial arthropods were used to monitor the process as an alternative to the use of secondary succession of plants or physico-chemical indicators of soils. This study analyzes the usefulness of the terrestrial arthropods at different taxonomic levels (orders of Arthropoda, families of Coleoptera, and species of Carabidae) as restoration indicators in the initial restoration stages. The terrestrial arthropods respond rapidly to restoration, and the results may be explained by short-term increase in abiotic factors resulting from the applied techniques, mainly the animal origin of the organic matter added and the biodegradable coconut geotextile. Carabidae is of relatively low value as a short-term restoration indicator at a specific level. Coleoptera provided the best information for interpreting the ecological results over the short term and had the best relationship with the cost of identification. Likewise, the results showed that the edaphic-landscape restoration leads to an abnormal arthropod assemblage in the short term because of an excessive abundance of isopods and polydesmids. No clear convergence appeared toward any of the terrestrial arthropod communities present in the grassland, scrubland, or woodland semi-natural areas, which were used as reference end point. The restoration indicator value produced by the higher taxonomic levels of the studied terrestrial arthropods may be useful and cost-effective for assessing short-term changes caused by environmental restorations performed to recover ecosystems affected by mining activities.

In common with other fast algorithms for time-series adaptive filtering, this algorithm only requires O(p) operations for the solution of a pth-order problem. Unlike previous fast algorithms based on the QRD technique, the algorithm presented here explicitly produces the transversal filter weights. Furthermore the derivation of the algorithm is achieved, quite simply, by means of signal-flow-graph manipulation.

In this paper, breather and rogue waves solutions for such a system are investigated via the Darboux transformation. The spatially and temporally periodic breathers have been found. When the cubic nonlinearity coefficient and the background amplitude are varied, the propagating trajectories of breather are changed. The interaction between two breathers are also studied, which shows that when the wave numbers are close, the two breathers are partially coalesced. All of the first-, second-, and third-order rogue waves present certain lumps or valleys around a center in the temporal-spatial distribution, and the peak heights of the ion-acoustic waves are more than three times those of the background. However, for the high-frequency electrostatic waves, the values around the centers are less than the background intensity.

The morphology and structure analysis of the hybrid TiO2/Fe2O3 composites indicated uniform, conformal coating of the hematite nanoparticles on the anatase titania nanotubes. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to investigate the absorption properties of the TiO2/Fe2O3 structures. An increase in the absorbance of visible light in the range 380 nm to 600 nm has been observed when compared with pristine nanotubes. This is similar to the visible light absorbance enhancement observed in Ru-dye sensitized titania nanotubes. Thus iron oxide decorated titania nanotube demonstrate immense potential for use as inexpensive and robust materials for improved solar energy harvesting for photovoltaic applications.

140,"A characteristic feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is accumulation of apoptotic resistant fibroblasts/myofibroblasts in the fibroblastic foci. As caveolin (Cav)-null mice develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), we hypothesized that the participating fibroblasts display an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. To test this hypothesis and identify the molecular mechanisms involved we isolated lung fibroblasts from Cav-null mice and examined the expression of several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), of c-FLIP, of Bcl-2 proteins and of the death receptor CD95/Fas. We found significant increase in XIAP and c-FLIP constitutive protein expression with no alteration of Bcl-2 and lower levels of CD95/Fas. The isolated fibroblasts were then treated with the CD95/Fas ligand (FasL) to induce apoptosis. While the morphological and biochemical alterations induced by FasL were similar in wild-type (wt) and Cav-null mouse lung fibroblasts, the time course and the extent of the alterations were greater in the Cav-null fibroblasts. Several salient features of Cav-null fibroblasts response such as loss of membrane potential, fragmentation of the mitochondrial continuum concurrent with caspase-8 activation, and subsequent Bid cleavage, prior to caspase-3 activation were detected. Furthermore, M30 antigen formation, phosphatidylserine expression and DNA fragmentation were caspase-3 dependent. SiRNA-mediated silencing of XIAP and c-FLIP, individually or combined, enhanced the sensitivity of lung fibroblasts to FasL-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 had no effect. Together our findings support a mechanism in which CD95/Fas engagement activates caspase-8, inducing mitochondrial apoptosis through Bid cleavage. XIAP and c-FLIP fine tune this process in a cell-type specific manner.

141,"Adtpp is an open-source tool that adds support for algebraic data types (ADTs) to the C programming language. ADTs allow more precise description of program types and more robust handling of data structures than are directly supported by C. ADT definitions and other declarations are put in a file that is preprocessed by adtpp to produce a C header (.h') file that can be included in C source files. The generated header file contains C type definitions, macros, and inline functions that support type-safe construction, deconstruction, and pattern matching of ADT values while avoiding unsafe operations such as casts, and avoiding the risk of errors such as dereferencing NULL pointers and accessing inappropriate fields of unions. Values are represented efficiently, using techniques from the implementation of declarative languages. For many simple data types, the memory representation is identical to a direct implementation in C, with no loss of efficiency. For more complex types, the adtpp representation is more efficient than common C representations while preserving type safety and convenience. As an example, we present a new variation of 234-trees that is very compact. Adtpp also supports parametric polymorphism such as defining a type list of t', where t can be any ADT, and generic functions such as length. However, polymorphic code is somewhat more verbose than for typical declarative languages, due to our reliance on the limited type checking available in C. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Vertebral body fracture was more frequent in the atrophic type, suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis at the onset of hip osteoarthritis. Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with increased bone formation at a local site. However, excessive bone resorption has also been found to occur in the early stages of OA. Osteoporosis may be involved in the onset of OA in elderly patients. We conducted a cross-sectional radiographic study of patients with hip OA and examined the association between age and factors of acetabular dysplasia (Sharp's angle, acetabular roof obliquity angle, and acetabular head index) as well as the osteoblastic response to determine the potential involvement of osteoporosis. Methods This study included 366 patients (58 men, 308 women) who had undergone total hip arthroplasty for the diagnosis of hip OA. We measured the parameters of acetabular dysplasia using preoperative frontal X-ray images and evaluated each patient according to Bombelli classification of OA (hypertrophic, normotrophic, or atrophic type). Results As the patients aged, the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased. The incidence of the atrophic type of OA was significantly higher in older patients. Vertebral body fractures were more frequent in the atrophic type than in the other types. Additionally, the index of acetabular dysplasia was lower in the atrophic type. By contrast, the hypertrophic type was present in relatively younger patients and was associated with an increased index of acetabular dysplasia. Conclusion In elderly patients with hip OA, the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased and the incidence of the atrophic type increased as the patients aged. The frequency of vertebral body fracture was high in patients with the atrophic type, suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis in the onset of hip OA.

148,"A rainwater harvesting system (RHS) was designed for a waste treatment facility located near the town of Mirandela (northern Portugal), to be used in the washing of vehicles and other equipment, the cleaning of outside concrete or asphalt floors, and the watering of green areas. Water tank volumes representing 100% efficiency (V-r) were calculated by the Ripple method with different results depending on two consumption scenarios adopted for irrigation. The RHS design was based on a precipitation record spanning a rather long period (3 decades). The calculated storage capacities fulfilled the water demand even when prolonged droughts occurred during that timeframe. However, because the drought events have been rather scarce the V-r values were considered oversized and replaced by optimal volumes. Notwithstanding the new volumes were solely half of the original V-r values, the projected RHS efficiency remained very high (around 90%) while the probability of system failure (efficiency < 100%) stayed very low (in the order of 5%). In both scenarios, the economic savings related to the optimization of V-r were noteworthy, while the investment's return periods decreased substantially from the original to the optimized solutions. A high efficiency with a low storage capacity is typical of low demanding applications of rainwater harvesting, where water availability (V-w) largely exceeds water demand (C-w), that is to say where demand fractions (C-w/V-w) are very low. Based on the results of a literature review covering an ample geographic distribution and describing a very large number of demand fraction scenarios, a C-w/V-w = 0.8 was defined as the threshold to generally distinguish the low from the high demanding RHS applications.

The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for this purpose. To date, the MODIS team had released several versions of VI products that have widely used in global change studies and practical applications. In this study, we re-examined the global vegetation activity by comparing the recent MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VIs with Collection 5 (C5) VIs including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Terra (2001-2015) and Aqua Satellites (2003-2015). We found substantial differences in global vegetation trends betweenTerra-C5 and -C6 VIs, especially EVI. From 2001 to 2015, global vegetation showed a remarkable greening trend in annual EVI from the Terra-C6 (0.28% year(-1) P < 0.001), in contrast to the decreasing EVI trend from the Terra-05 (-0.14% year(-1) P < 0.01). Spatially, large portions of the browning areas in tropical regions identified by Terra-05 VIs were not evident in Terra-C6 VIs. In contrast, the widespread greening areas in Terra-C6 VIs were consistent with Aqua C6 VIs and GIMMS3g NDVI. Our finding of a greening Earth supports the recent studies suggesting an enhanced land carbon sink. Our study suggests that most of the vegetation browning trends detected by MODIS Terra-C5 VIs were likely caused by sensor degradation, particularly for the period after 2007. Therefore, previous studies of temporal vegetation trends based solely on Terra-C5 VIs may need to be reevaluated. Our new analysis offers the most updated understanding of the global vegetation dynamics during the past 15 years and contributes to accurately understanding the role of vegetation played in the Earth's biogeochemical and climatic systems.

Efficient memory resource management requires knowledge of the memory demands of applications or systems at runtime.

Unfortunately, the cost of monitoring and maintaining the MRC structures is nontrivial. This article first introduces a low-cost WSS tracking system with effective optimizations on data structures, as well as an efficient mechanism to decrease the frequency of monitoring. We also propose a Memory Balancer (MEB), which dynamically reallocates guest memory based on the predicted WSS. Our experimental results show that our prediction schemes yield a high accuracy of 95.2% and low overhead of 2%. Furthermore, the overall system throughput can be significantly improved with MEB, which brings a speedup up to 7.4 for two to four VMs and 4.54 for an overcommitted system with 16 VMs.

The effectiveness and validation of the proposed method have been verified through different patterns of reference paths using MATLAB-Simulink software package. The stability of fractional-order system is analysed. Also, the robustness of the system is conducted by adding disturbances due to friction of wheels during the vehicle motion.

In this work, we synthesized a new kind of PDI and reported this aggregated PDI could quench the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-labeled fluorophores with a high quenching efficiency. The quenching efficiencies on the fluorescence of FAM, TAMRA and Cy5 could reach to 98.3% +/- 0.9%, 97.2% +/- 0.6% and 98.1% +/- 1.1%, respectively.

In situ hybridization was performed on a set of tissue microarray samples to assess the difference in miR-218 expression in vessels between tumor tissues and normal gastric mucosa. In vitro, ectopic expression of miR-218 disturbed the tubular structure and inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. Motility and tube formation were rescued when miR-218 was downregulated. Moreover, miR-218 suppressed endothelial cell sprouting in a fibrin bead sprouting assay. Subsequently, we identified ROBO1 as a target of miR-218 in endothelial cells and determined it was responsible for the effect of miR-218 on tumor angiogenesis. In vivo, local injection of mature miR-218 in xenografted tumors disrupted the vessel plexus and thus inhibited tumor growth.

In this study, single-chamber and membrane-less soil MFCs were constructed. The HCB was degraded to pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB), and trichlorobenzene (TCB) in sequence by a reductive dechlorination process in soil MFCs. The influences of the external resistance, concentration of phosphate buffer, and electrode spacing in soil MFCs on the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were analyzed. The results showed that the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were increased when the external resistance decreased from 2000 to 20 (1, and also when the concentration of phosphate buffer increased. The anode area played a significant role in dechlorination of HCB. Altering the spacing of the reducing electrode resulted in a lower ohmic resistance in the soil MFCs. The ohmic resistance was negatively correlated with the removal efficiency and degradation rate (P < 0.05). In conclusion, HCB removal efficiency could be enhanced by soil MFCs, the performance of which was improved by a decrease in external resistance and internal resistance, and an increase in phosphate buffer concentration, rather than just by shortening the electrode spacing.

In addition to abnormal anatomy, changes in kinematics, joint reaction forces (JRFs), and muscle forces could cause tissue damage to the cartilage and labrum, and may contribute to pain and fatigue. The objective of this study was to compare lower extremity joint angles, moments, hip JRFs and muscle forces during gait between patients with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia and healthy controls. Marker trajectories and ground reaction forces were measured in 10 dysplasia patients and 10 typically developing control subjects. A musculoskeletal model was scaled in OpenSim to each subject and subject-specific hip joint centers were determined using reconstructions from CT images. Joint kinematics and moments were calculated using inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics, respectively. Muscle forces and hip JRFs were estimated with static optimization. Inter-group differences were tested for statistical significance (p= 0.8). Results demonstrated that dysplasia patients had higher medially directed JRFs. Joint angles and moments were mostly similar between the groups, but large inter-group effect sizes suggested some restriction in range of motion by patients at the hip and ankle. Higher medially-directed JRFs and inter-group differences in hip muscle forces likely stem from lateralization of the hip joint center in dysplastic patients. Joint force differences, combined with reductions in range of motion at the hip and ankle may also indicate compensatory strategies by patients with dysplasia to maintain joint stability.

Their cytotoxic nature was attributed to affecting the mitochondrial enzyme activity, proliferation capability, and the formation of tight junctions in cancer cells. The endocytosis was found to be internalization mechanism for the cellular uptake of nanosheets. The generation of reactive oxygen species and elicitation of caspase-3 activity which was undoubtedly associated with triggering of oxidative stress speculated to be the dominant cause of the cytotoxic pattern of nanosheets against cancer cells. Additionally, the results also showed the role of the nanosheets as a pH-sensitive drug carrier through drug loading by supramolecular interaction. The efficient release of doxorubicin was seen at low pH and in an environment with a low oxygen concentration, thus under conditions mimicking the typical tumor microenvironment.

Easy-to-use dimensionless curves between demand fraction and storage fraction were obtained for five rainwater supply reliabilities of the DRWHS for the four sub-regions. Based on the dimensionless curves, a nomogram was constructed for designing DRWHSs at a rainwater supply reliability of 95% in the sub-region I. Storage capacities determined from the dimensionless curves showed a close fit with those determined from simulated values, but were larger than the values estimated from the method presented in the Green Building Evaluation Manual in most situations. The methodology developed herein can be used effectively for the preliminary design of a DRWHS and for overcoming the difficulties faced in designing a DRWHS without rainfall data and with incomplete rainfall data.

162,"As one of the biggest countries in the world and the 4th rank in construction industry in Asia, Indonesia is very far behind compared to some neighboring countries in terms of green building movement. It is confirmed by the fact that only 16 buildings in Indonesia that have been earned GREENSHIP, the certification issued by the Green Building Council Indonesia up to present. Therefore, the research was conducted to identify the barriers to green building movement in Indonesia from building occupants' point of view. The data presented in this paper are mainly derived from interviews and responses to a questionnaire which distributed randomly to building occupants who had experiences either in conventional or in green buildings around Jakarta and Bandung. Based on the findings from 75 respondents, it was identified that the barriers are: burdensome implementation, lack of supported atmospheres, resistance to change, inadequate knowledge and information, negligence, high cost of green building options, insufficient supervision, lack of awareness, low availability of green products on the market, and lack of building management role. The work concludes with recommendations of performance improvement strategies analyzed by SWOT method. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

163,"A one-dimensional finite element method for generally layered smart beams is presented in this paper. The model implements the first-order shear deformation beam theory and is based on the preliminary analytical condensation of the electric state to the mechanical state. This allows us to establish an effective mechanical beam kinematically equivalent to the original smart beam including the effects of electro-elastic couplings. The contributions of the external electric loads are included in both the equivalent stiffness properties and the equivalent mechanical boundary conditions. Hermite shape functions, which depend on parameters representative of the staking sequence through the equivalent electro-elastic stiffness coefficients, are used to formulate the finite element method. The state space representation is then invoked for the assembled smart beam finite element model to favor its implementation in a block diagram environment for multi-domain simulation. Validation results and solutions for passive and active vibrations damping system are presented last.

164,"An optical method is developed to estimate water transparency (or underwater visibility) in terms of Secchi depth (Z(sd)), which follows the remote sensing and contrast transmittance theory. The major factors governing the variation in Z(sd), namely, turbidity and length attenuation coefficient (1/(c + K-d), c = beam attenuation coefficient; K-d = diffuse attenuation coefficient at 531 nm), are obtained based on band rationing techniques. It was found that the band ratio of remote sensing reflectance (expressed as (R-rs(443) + R-rs(490))/ (R-rs(555) + R-rs(670)) contains essential information about the water column optical properties and thereby positively correlates to turbidity. The beam attenuation coefficient (c) at 531 nm is obtained by a linear relationship with turbidity. To derive the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at 531 nm, K-d(490) is estimated as a function of reflectance ratio (R-rs(670)/R-rs(490)), which provides the bio-optical link between chlorophyll concentration and K-d(531). The present algorithm was applied to MODIS-Aqua images, and the results were evaluated by matchup comparisons between the remotely estimated Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) in coastal waters off Point Calimere and its adjoining regions on the southeast coast of India. The results showed the pattern of increasing Z(sd) from shallow turbid waters to deep clear waters. The statistical evaluation of the results showed that the percent mean relative error between the MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) values was within +/- 25%. A close agreement achieved in spatial contours of MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) for the month of January 2014 and August 2013 promises the model capability to yield accurate estimates of Zsd in coastal, estuarine, and inland waters. The spatial contours have been included to provide the best data visualization of the measured, modeled (in situ), and satellite-derived Z(sd) products. The modeled and satellite-derived Z(sd) values were compared with measurement data which yielded RMSE = 0.079, MRE = -0.016, and R-2 = 0.95 for the modeled Z(sd) and RMSE = 0.075, MRE = 0.020, and R-2 = 0.95 for the satellite-derived Z(sd) products.

Guided by the life-course perspective, we analyzed qualitative interview data from members of 27 African American families including the person with MCI (PwMCI), a relative or friend who was highly involved in the PwMCI's daily life, and if available, a relative or friend who had at least monthly contact with the PwMCI. Findings uncovered variability in families' MCI awareness, assessment, and need for role changes; the importance of reaching out to trusted others; and honoring PwMCI's care preferences (e.g., who should provide care). Families held varying beliefs about engaging outside support; some families insisted on keeping all care within the family while others were open to the use of external services. We showcase how diagnosis acceptance and family decision-making are at the heart of how African American families respond to MCI.

168,"A low energy- noise switched-capacitor (SC) sensor interface for resistive bridge sensor is presented. The SC amplifier achieves low-power metric with two operating modes using operation-phase-dependent biasing and compensation scheme in the op-amp design. This novel op-amp works in high-bandwidth high-power mode to sample the bridge signal for 13 mu s twice and in low-bandwidth low-power mode for 474 mu s over 500 mu s measurement interval. To further reduce the power of the SC amplifier in system level, a SC level-shift design is adopted. Regarding offset calibration, a capacitor divider based trimming scheme is implemented to generate the mid-point DC output voltage under the constraint of the feedback capacitor size. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the SC interface together with the regulator, voltage reference and trimming circuit occupies an area of 0.358 mm(2). For the first test setup utilizing Half Wheatstone Bridge, the proposed SC amplifier consumes 12.3 mu W at 1 V regulated supply with a 2 kHz system clock. The measured Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of SC circuit is 55.6 dB. In the second test setup using a commercial sensor with 0.092 mV/kPa sensitivity, the interface has demonstrated the sensing function with sensitivity of 3.52 mV/kPa. Finally, compared to the representative prior-arts, this work has achieved the best energy-noise figure-of-merit at identical fractional resistance change.

Recently, an artificial muscle and a micro actuator have been developed using a new smart material and internal flow control. Thus, the actuating velocity of the fabricated integrated hybrid system was investigated using the pumping frequency and load weight. The actuating velocity was then calculated using a developed program, and the numerical result was compared with the experimental result to validate the numerical program. Also, the internal flow rate was measured to analyze the pump efficiency experimentally. The flow rate inside the integrated hybrid actuator calculated using a CFD program for various pumping frequencies was then compared with the experimental results. The maximum outlet velocity was obtained at the pumping frequency of 35 Hz and the velocity decreased from that point due to flow loss.

In this study, we investigated region wide glacier thickness change in the Central Tien Shan (CTS) during 2000-2012 by differencing the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) with a newly constructed DEM from 27 TanDEM-X images. For a total glacier area of 7239.8 +/- 527.2 km(2), an average glacier thickness change rate of -0.24 +/- 0.22 m/a was derived. This result agrees well with the result based on satellite laser altimetry measurements reported earlier (-0.31 +/- 0.41 m/a). With temporal synchronization, a fine spatial resolution and wide coverage, our measurements are able to reveal abundant glacier change features and dependencies in the CTS. Firstly, the lower mountains have seen a more severe glacier decline, and the glaciers facing the prevailing wind (westerlies) have experienced a greater decline because of the stronger evaporation. Furthermore, those glaciers lying along the extremely high Meridian mountain range have obviously gained mass in their upper reaches, because the air current from the west is blocked and lifted by the Meridian mountain range. Secondly, for the entire glacier body, the theoretical hyperbolic dependence between debris thickness and ice decline was very difficult to establish. Some huge glaciers covered by heavy debris have still experienced a severe decline. However, even though the heavy debris did not prevent the ablation, its attenuating effects were considerable. Thirdly, for the glaciers that surged before 2000, the mass gain in the restoring zones has not been enough to cover the mass loss in ablation zones. Some large glaciers surged again during 2000-2012; however, with much lower magnitudes than in previous surges. In general, the surge glaciers have experienced a greater decline than the non-surge glaciers. Fourthly, due to the ice front calving and subglacial thermal erosion, glaciers connected to proglacial lakes have receded and thinned much more rapidly than the land-terminated glaciers. Overall, the glaciers in the CTS are more stable than those in other parts of the Tien Shan. However, the glacier state there is still alarming. A moderate average thinning rate was derived because the drastic thinning in the ablation zones was balanced by the slight thinning in the broad accumulation zones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, we extend the previous view by: (a) proposing a novel Bayesian cost function that can be interpreted as a general probabilistic formulation of the well-known project-out loss; (b) introducing two new types of composition, asymmetric and bidirectional, that combine the gradients of both image and appearance model to derive better convergent and more robust CGD algorithms; and (c) providing new valuable insights into existent CGD algorithms by reinterpreting them as direct applications of the Schur complement and the Wiberg method.

To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel data structure called brightness distribution matrix (BDM) which can be used to accurately model regional brightness. Based on our proposed consistency constraints and energy function, we can obtain motion vectors from image sequences with high accuracy. Since the BDM-based ME approach requires a large number of computations when dealing with complex fluid scenarios, to reduce the overall ME time, a parallelized version of our approach is developed based on graphics processing unit (GPU). Experimental results show that our GPU-based approach not only can be used to improve the ME quality for complex fluid images, but also can reduce the overall ME processing time (up to 7.06 times improvement).

A liquid metal galinstan sphere, along with a NaOH solution, is stimulated to rotate centrifugally around the central electrode and the rotating speed increases with the voltage. The NaOH solution serves to rapidly remove the oxide on the liquid metal surface, reduce the motion friction and provide impetus to the liquid metal. As the mass of the liquid metal is increased to 12.16 g to form a kidney-like body, its rotating speed appears more controllable and the effect of the electrolytic action in the NaOH solution becomes weak in the range of 0-1.82 V.

Although various modern trackers have impressive performance, some challenges such as occlusion and target scale variation are still intractable, especially in the complex scenarios. This paper proposes a robust scale adaptive tracking algorithm to predict target scale by a sequential Monte Carlo method and determine the target location by the correlation filter simultaneously. By analyzing the response map of the target region, the completeness of the target can be measured by the peak-to-sidelobe rate (PSR), i.e., the lower the PSR, the more likely the target is being occluded. A strict template update strategy is designed to accommodate the appearance change and avoid template corruption. If the occlusion occurs, a retained scheme is allowed and the tracker refrains from drifting away. Additionally, the feature integration is incorporated to guarantee the robustness of the proposed approach.

There are no publications in literature about the possible existence of memristors and electrical differentiators in fruits. Here we found that the electrostimulation of Golden Delicious or Arkansas Black apple fruits by bipolar periodic waves induces hysteresis loops with pinched points in cyclic voltammograms at low frequencies between 0.1 MHz and 1 MHz. At high frequencies of 1 kHz, the pinched hysteresis loop transforms to a non-pinched hysteresis loop instead of a single line I= V / R for ideal memristors because the amplitude of electrical current depends on capacitance of a fruit's tissue and electrodes, frequency and direction of scanning. Electrostimulation of electrical circuits in apple fruits by periodic voltage waves also induces electrotonic potential propagation due to cell-to-cell electrical coupling with electrical differentiators. A differentiator is an electrical circuit in which the output of the circuit is approximately directly proportional to the rate of change of the input.

The redox behavior showed an increase in cathodic catalytic activity with an increase in the inter-electrode distance. Spatiometabolic distribution depicted the microbial stratification on the anode. Electrochemically active bacteria present on the anode surface (inner and outer layers of biofilms) showed relatively uniform diversity compared with the suspension culture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

196,"A hidden Markov model (HMM) consisting of a controlled Markov chain and a binary output is considered. The binary output reports the occurrence of a certain state (versus any other state) in the Markov chain. The transition matrix of the Markov chain depends on a control vector which is to be chosen to minimize a discounted infinite-horizon cost function. The information provided for decision making is the entire history of the binary output which presents an incomplete knowledge of the Markov chain and, as a consequence, leads to a stochastic control problem with partial observations. The solution to such a problem is a control policy consisting of two components: an estimator to derive the posterior probability distribution of the Markov chain from the observation set, and a nonlinear control law to map this estimate into the control vector. This paper introduces a nonlinear state-space representation for the estimator, develops analytical expressions for the control law, and presents numerical methods for efficient computation of the optimal control. Application of these results to optimal management of a class of inventory systems is discussed, and the performance of optimal control for this application is examined by numerical simulations.

197,"Agricultural expansion and intensification are main drivers of land-use change in Brazil. Soybean is the major crop under expansion in the area. Soybean production involves large amounts of water and fertiliser that act as sources of contamination with potentially negative impacts on adjacent water bodies. These impacts might be intensified by projected climate change in tropical areas. A Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) serves as a tool to assess environmental impacts of water and fertiliser use. The aim of this study was to understand potential impacts on environmental sustainability of agricultural intensification close to a protected forest area of the Amazon under climate change. We carried out a WFA to calculate the water footprint (WF) related to soybean production, Glycine max, to understand the sustainability of the WF in the Tapajos river basin, a region in the Brazilian Amazon with large expansion and intensification of soybean. Based on global datasets, environmental hotspots potentially unsustainable WF areas were identified and spatially plotted in both baseline scenario (2010) and projection into 2050 through the use of a land-use change scenario that includes climate change effects. Results show green and grey WF values in 2050 increased by 304%, and 268%, respectively. More than one-third of the watersheds doubled their grey WF in 2050. Soybean production in 2010 lies within sustainability I imits. However, current soybean expansion and intensification trends lead to large impacts in relation to water pollution and water use, affecting protected areas. Areas not impacted in terms of water pollution dropped by 20.6% in 2050 for the whole catchment, while unsustainability increased 8.1%. Management practices such as water consumption regulations to stimulate efficient water use, reduction of crop water use and evapotranspiration, and optimal fertiliser application control could be key factors in achieving sustainability wiLhin a river basin.

198,"A new nonlinear dimensionality reduction method called kernel global-local preserving projections (KGLPP) is developed and applied for fault detection. KGLPP has the advantage of preserving global and local data structures simultaneously. The kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), which only preserves the global Euclidean structure of data, and the kernel locality preserving projections (KLPP), which only preserves the local neighborhood structure of data, are unified in the KGLPP framework. KPCA and KLPP can be easily derived from KGLPP by choosing some particular values of parameters. As a result, KGLPP is more powerful than KPCA and KLPP in capturing useful data characteristics. A KGLPP-based monitoring method is proposed for nonlinear processes. T-2 and SPE statistics are constructed in the feature space for fault detection. Case studies in a nonlinear system and in the Tennessee Eastman process demonstrate that the KGLPP-based method significantly outperforms KPCA, KLPP and GLPP-based methods, in terms of higher fault detection rates and better fault sensitivity.

199,"A platform for electrochemical transduction suitable for miniaturised point-of-care diagnostic solutions with intuitive optical read-out was designed. Electrolytic current from electrochemical cell was transduced into the glow of a light-emitting diode. Its performance was optimised and several variants of transducing circuitry were tested. The circuit comprising field-effect transistor (FET) exhibited the sought abilities - absolute simplicity and high and tuneable sensitivity of the transducing device. Limit-of-detection, i.e. a signal readable by naked-eye without any additional instrumentation was as low as 4 mu M for direct assay of H2O2. The whole transducing system employing FET consisted of 4 off-the-shelf components and its price reached <0.3 (sic) even at small-scale experimental production. As our system was rather suitable for the semiquantitative ""YES/NO"" applications due to the steep response curve, an alternative circuitry for widening the linear range was also probed.

200,"A full-scale test embankment was constructed on a soft deposit (S-u < 20 kPa) improved by geotextile-encased granular columns to assess its serviceability performance for a nearby stockyard foundation. The behaviour of the improved foundation was monitored by means of instrumentation with respect to surface settlements, excess pore pressures, total vertical stresses acting on the top of the encased column and surrounding soft soil as well as geotextile radial deformation. Two-dimensional finite-element analysis was performed using an axi-symmetric unit cell, and then the results were compared with field measurements. It was observed that the soil arching progressed during post-construction due to a decrease in apparent stiffness of soft clay from quasi undrained to drained stiffness. Furthermore, there was a difference in settlement between the top of the encased column and the surrounding soft soil, midpoint between the columns, which increased during both construction and consolidation stages. A measured relation was also found to correlate the geotextile expansion with the maximum settlement occurring below the embankment.

Results indicated that food selectivity was both the most frequently reported type of challenging feeding behavior and the most often reported as problematic but was also the only type of challenging feeding behavior that was not associated with parenting stress. Greater parenting stress was reported when co-parenting agreement and support were lower. Child disruptive behavior at mealtime was the only feeding challenge associated with quality of co-parenting.

209,"Across the globe, economic fluctuations have taken their toll on both organizations and employees, particularly during sustained recessions. Surprisingly, little research, however, has directly investigated the effects of recessions on employees. As such, the goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of specific recession-related stressors on employee outcomes (strain and satisfaction). We investigated an archival data set of 7666 individuals collected as part of the Workplace Employment Relations Study for relations among recession-related stressors with strain and job satisfaction variables. We found that recession-related stressors were significantly related to both strain and satisfaction. More specifically, certain recession-related stressors (e.g. increased workload and reorganization of work) were more strongly related to strain and satisfaction than others. These results imply the need for greater attention to stress management strategies aimed at helping both employees and their organizations cope with the human costs of economic recessions.

Average monthly runoff efficiency over these 2 years, was 16%, 18%, 19%, 65%, 71%, 77%, 70%, 72% and 79% for SR30, SR45, SR60, BMR30, BMR45, BMR50, CMR30, CMR45 and CMR60 (SR, BMR and CMR were ridges with manually compacted soil, mulched with bio-degradable mulch film and common plastic film, respectively, and subscripts 30,45 and 60 refer to ridge widths (cm) all with 60 6-11 furrow width), respectively. For the same treatments, threshold rainfall was 4.3, 4.3, 4.2, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.9, 2.9 and 2.8 mm. The field experiment showed that ridge mulching materials and ridge widths had distinct effects on topsoil temperature at ridge tops, but not at furrow bottoms. Soil water storage in 140 cm soil depth at furrow bottoms increased with increasing ridge width and in the order of CMR approximate to BMR>SR>FP. Average annual total forage yields for FP, SR, BMR and CMR were 6276, 5642, 7563 and 7817 kg ha(-1), respectively, over 2 years. The total precipitation in both years was higher than average of rainfall, leading to significant decreases of forage yields for SR, and significant increases of forage yields for BMR and CMR. Compared with FP, average forage yields decreased by 3%, 10% and 17% for SR30, SR45 and SR60, and increased by 27%, 21%, 13%, 32%, 26% and 16% for BMR30, BMR45, BMR50, CMR30, CMR45 and CMR60, respectively, over 2 years.

215,"5G mobile networks are promising to offer mobile users unrivaled experiences with infinite networking capability at any period and from anywhere. However, it appears unnecessary and impractical for the customers and servers to be connected permanently in wireless networks because battery life is a bottleneck in such kind of networks. Therefore, the authorized entity needs to delegate its right to others in order to ensure the services available. This paper aims to address the issue of delegating authentication in 5G networks by proposing a new proxy signature scheme with efficient proxy signing operations. Concretely, we present a new and efficient proxy signature algorithm whose unforgeability can be reduced to the well-known discrete logarithm assumption. In the proposal, the original signer delegates his signing right by signing an exposure-free chameleon hash value on the warrant, and the proxy signer can generate a proxy signature on a message only by calculating a chameleon hash collision between the warrant and the message. This approach is computationally cost-effective for the proxy signer. Further analysis of the new scheme demonstrates that it offers the desirable properties of delegation of signing sights.

The phase difference between the two orthogonally polarized feedback fringes is observed, and the tiny displacement of the object can be measured through the phase change of the synthetic signal.

217,"An experimental program of large-scale direct shear tests has indicated that shear displacement of a gravel drainage layer and nonwoven geotextile protection layer over a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane under moderate to high normal stress conditions can cause much greater damage to the geomembrane than static pressure alone. Essentially, no damage was observed at low normal stress. The greatest damage occurred at high normal stress (1,389 kPa) using a lightweight geotextile (335 g/m(2)) and yielded an average of 31 holes/m(2), with a maximum hole size of 29 mm. Surprisingly, geomembrane damage measured using a lightweight geotextile was greater than that measured using no geotextile due to a change in failure surface location. For the same conditions, shear-induced damage was slightly less for a geomembrane placed on a compacted sand subgrade than on a compacted clay subgrade. Interface shear strength increased significantly with decreasing geotextile mass/area due to greater out-of-plane deformation of the geomembrane. The findings suggest that the placement of a gravel drainage layer on top of a HDPE geomembrane, even with a protection nonwoven geotextile, should be viewed with caution for landfill bottom liner systems and other moderate-to high-stress applications. If there is a reasonable expectation for interface shear displacement, project-specific direct shear tests should be conducted to determine the potential for shear-induced geomembrane damage.

218,"Agent-based simulations are increasingly popular in exploring and understanding cellular systems, but the natural complexity of these systems and the desire to grasp different modelling levels demand cost-effective simulation strategies and tools. In this context, the present paper introduces novel sequential and distributed approaches for the three-dimensional agent-based simulation of individual molecules in cellular events. These approaches are able to describe the dimensions and position of the molecules with high accuracy and thus, study the critical effect of spatial distribution on cellular events. Moreover, two of the approaches allow multi-thread high performance simulations, distributing the three-dimensional model in a platform independent and computationally efficient way. Evaluation addressed the reproduction of molecular scenarios and different scalability aspects of agent creation and agent interaction. The three approaches simulate common biophysical and biochemical laws faithfully. The distributed approaches show improved performance when dealing with large agent populations while the sequential approach is better suited for small to medium size agent populations. Overall, the main new contribution of the approaches is the ability to simulate three-dimensional agent-based models at the molecular level with reduced implementation effort and moderate-level computational capacity. Since these approaches have a generic design, they have the major potential of being used in any event-driven agent-based tool. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

222,"A new technique called geotextile mattress with floating curtain (GMFC) may be an advisable alternative countermeasure against seabed erosion, since it can allow deposited sediment dunes to form naturally at upstream and downstream sides of GMFC when installed in erosive flow. However, cyclic loading of wave actions can lead to liquefaction of the seabed under the mattress, reducing the maximum friction resistance of the mattress, even leading to instability of the GMFC structure. Thus, in this study a series of physical model tests in a rectangular flume were carried out to investigate the behavior of a single GMFC and the hydrodynamic environment around GMFC subjected to wave loading. The wave force on seabed was recorded by pressure gauges installed on the flume bed. Experimental results indicated that some area of the unmovable bed around GMFC suffered much higher hydrodynamic pressure under the wave action. The areas directly facing the bottom openings of GMFC are more prone to bear higher cyclic force of wave actions. Moreover, the results also illustrated that the highest cyclic force of wave actions on the seabed appears at a distance of the mattress-curtain height to the GMFC centerline.

The oscillations range covers high angles of attack (up to 65 degrees) and reduced frequencies (up to 0.95) with particular attention to the range of flow nonlinearities over which lift enhancement is observed. Experiments were performed in a wind tunnel on an airfoil section at a Reynolds number of 80,000. Airfoil acceleration and lift force data were used to determine the frequency response functions between the measured unsteady lift and the quasi-steady lift. The results show enhanced lift amplitude over the stall regime at a reduced frequency of 0.7. The flow dynamics associated with this observation were identified from water tunnel experiments. Particular attention is paid to the flow separation and consequent formation and convection of the leading edge vortex.

233,"AIM To determine the placebo response rate associated with different types of placebo interventions used in psychological intervention studies for irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS Randomized controlled trials comparing psychological interventions (stress management/relaxation therapy (cognitive) behavioral therapy, short-term psychodynamic therapy, and hypnotherapy) for the treatment of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosed with the Manning or Rome criteria with an adequate placebo control treatment and reporting data on IBS symptom severity were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases. Full-text articles that were written in English and published between 1966 and February 2016 in peer-reviewed journals were selected for the present review. Placebo interventions were considered to be adequate if the number of sessions and the amount of time spent with the therapist were the same as in the active treatment. The placebo response rate (PRR) was computed for IBS symptom severity (primary outcome measure) as well as for anxiety, depression and quality of life (secondary outcome measures). RESULTS Six studies, with a total of 555 patients met the inclusion criteria. Four studies used an educational intervention, whereas two studies used a form of supportive therapy as the placebo intervention. The PRR for IBS symptom severity ranged from 25% to 59%, with a pooled mean of 41.4%. The relative PRR for the secondary outcome measures ranged from 0% to 267% for anxiety, 6% to 52% for depression 20% to 125% for quality of life. The PRR associated with pharmacological treatments, treatment with dietary bran and complementary medicine ranged from 37.5% to 47%. Contrary to our expectations, the PRR in studies on psychological interventions was comparable to that in studies on pharmacological, dietary and alternative medical interventions. CONCLUSION The PRR is probably determined to a larger extent by patient-related factors, such as expectations and desire for the treatment to be effective, than the content of the placebo intervention.

234,"An approach to performing linguistic summaries of graph datasets, with particular focus on usage of ontologies is presented in this paper. This well-known mining technique is based on fuzzy set theory, which is used to model natural language words (e.g. 'many', 'tall'), and in result-generates natural-like sentences describing the data. Although intensely developed, before our work this method has been applied only to relational databases, while more and more data is available in graph model. A special case of such graph datasets is the Semantic Web, in which ontologies provide meaning, therefore enabling advanced machine learning. In our paper we analyze the problem of generating linguistic summaries for a graph data case (for which the method cannot be directly applied), with associated ontologies. The key element of ontologies are concept hierarchies, which are the core of our work. Firstly, due to heterogeneity and lack of schema we propose to use an ontological concept (including all sub-concepts in hierarchy) as a subject for summaries, and extract their attributes (neighboring vertexes). Then we show that by ascending these ontological concept hierarchies (so by attribute-based induction) we obtain additional, generalized summaries. We showthis process for both summarizers and qualifiers, and propose an extension to their respective imprecision measures -T-2 and T-9. We perform two experiments on DBPedia-one for summary subject 'Artist', and second for 'Musical Album'. For the latter, we show the optimized process of obtaining the truth values using bottom-up approach.

The Painleve analysis is discussed to illustrate the integrability of the model equation. An auto-Backlund transformation is presented via the truncated expansion and symbolic computation. The results show that the exact solutions of the model introduce solitary waves of different types. The solutions of the hydrodynamic model and the van der Waals equation exhibit a behavior similar to the one observed in molecular dynamic simulations such that two pairs of shock and rarefaction waves appear and move away, giving rise to the bubbles. The dispersion properties and the relation between group and phase velocities of the model equation are studied using the plane wave assumption.

242,"A 3D finite element (FE) model for the Sutong cable-stayed bridge (SCB) is established based on ANSYS. The dynamic characteristics of the bridge are analyzed using a subspace iteration method. Based on recorded wind data, the measured spectra expression is presented using the nonlinear least-squares regression method. Turbulent winds at the bridge site are simulated based on the spectral representation method and the FFT technique. The influence of some key structural parameters and measures on the dynamic characteristics of the bridge are investigated. These parameters include dead load intensity, as well as vertical, lateral and torsional stiffness of the steel box girder. In addition, the influence of elastic stiffness of the connection device employed between the towers and the girder on the vibration mode of the steel box girder is investigated. The analysis shows that all of the vertical, lateral and torsional buffeting displacement responses reduce gradually as the dead load intensity increases. The dynamic characteristics and the structural buffeting displacement response of the SCB are only slightly affected by the vertical and torsional stiffness of the steel box girder, and the lateral and torsional buffeting displacement responses reduce gradually as the lateral stiffness increases. These results provide a reference for dynamic analysis and design of super-long-span cable-stayed bridges.

These models are defined by an energy functional attached to an initial curve that evolves under some constraints to extract desired objects in the image. New models are proposed, and existing techniques are investigated and improved in different domains. Among these ACM, Balloon ACM is an edge-based model that adds a normal force as constraint making the curve to have more dynamic behaviors and more effectiveness in detecting objects boundary. However, some problems have been pointed out including segmentation of complex shape and high runtime processing. In this paper, we develop a new method -called Fast Adaptive Balloon (FAB)-sufficient to segment complex shape with lower computational complexity. The proposed definition for balloon force achieves satisfactory segmentation performance compared with other ACMs using both synthetic and medical images in two dimension.

245,"A closed loop frequency tracking electronics circuit has been proposed for the measurement of pressure and temperature using a newly developed Langasite (LGS) piezo crystals. The ambient force and heat applied on the LGS crystal produces the shift in its resonant frequency. The proposed closed loop electronics tracks the shift in resonant frequency and measures the pressure and temperature by relating to the difference in frequency shift. The steady state oscillation condition of the resonator circuit is analytically derived and experimentally verified. The experimental setup consists of an operational amplifier based resonator circuit connected to the langasite piezo crystal placed between a double side diametric forces loading device with temperature controller bath. The diametric force applied on the LGS crystal produces the frequency shift in its fundamental mechanical vibration mode (Cmode). Similarly, the change in temperature produces the frequency shift in its second mechanical vibrational mode (Bmode). The frequency shifts are measured using two separate closed loop resonator electronics for two different measurand. Whenever the force on the LGS crystal is changed by the external unknown pressure, an additional intrinsic material property change is added to the piezo and changes the fundamental oscillating resonant frequency. The closed loop resonant circuit tracks the change in resonance frequency and vibrates the LGS with the new resonance frequency depends on the external pressure strength. Similar procedure is followed for temperature induce frequency tracking measurement also. The proposed frequency tracking electronics concept is simple and it is found that it has high sensitivity and linearity.

In this study, an Ag-based plasmonic catalyst supported on mesoporous silica with isolated and tetrahedrally coordinated single-site Ti-oxide moieties, namely, Ag/Ti-SBA-15, was designed with the purpose of utilizing the broad spectral range of solar energy. The Ti-SBA-15 support allows the deposition of small Ag NPs with a narrow size distribution. The chemical structure, morphology, and optical properties of the prepared catalyst were characterized by techniques such as UV/Vis, FT extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission SEM, TEM, and N-2 physisorption studies. The catalytic activity of Ag/Ti-SBA-15 in hydrogen production from ammonia borane by hydrolysis was significantly enhanced in comparison with Ag/SBA-15 without Ti-oxide moieties and Ag/TiO2/SBA-15 involving agglomerated TiO2, both in the dark and under light irradiation. Improved electron transfer under light irradiation caused by the creation of heterojunctions between Ag NPs and Ti-oxide moieties explains the results obtained in the present study.

Given the fact that non spherical solids naturally develop variations in their angular orientation during the fall, none-intrusiveness of the technique of analysis is of paramount importance in order to preserve the particle/fluid interaction undisturbed. Three-dimensional quantitative data about the motion parameters is obtained through single-camera stereo vision whilst qualitative visualizations of the adjacent fluid patterns are achieved with Schlieren photography. The methodology was validated by comparing the magnitudes of the drag coefficient of a set of spherical particles at terminal velocity conditions against those estimated from drag correlations published in the literature. A noteworthy similarity was attained. During the fall of non-spherical solids, once the particle Reynolds number approximated 163 for disks, and 240 for cylinders, or exceeded those values, secondary motions composed by regular oscillations and tumbling were present They altered the angular orientation of the particles with respect to the main motion direction and caused complete turbulent patterns in the surrounding flow, therefore affecting the instantaneous projected area, drag force, and coefficient of resistance. The impact of the changes in angular orientation onto the drag coefficient was shown graphically as a means for reinforcing existing numerical approaches, however, an explicit relation between both variables could not be observed.

Conclusion Our findings suggest that high levels of leisure-time aerobic exercise play a protective role in healthy sleep, while the excessive muscle-strength activity might increase the risk of both extremely short and long sleep durations.

272,"AIM To confirm previous conclusions on Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) CNCM I-3856 for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management. METHODS An individual patient data meta-analysis was per-formed on two randomized clinical trials studying the effect of S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 supplementation on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in IBS subjects. A total of 579 IBS subjects were included. Outcomes were the daily Likert scale scores of abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating [area under the curve (AUC) and weekly means], responder status, and bowel movements (stool frequency and consistency). Statistical analyses were conducted in Intent to Treat (ITT) population, IBS-C subjects and IBS-C subjects with an abdominal pain/ discomfort score higher than or equal to 2 at baseline ("" IBS-C (>=) 2 subpopulation""). RESULTS S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 significantly improved abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating during the second month of supplementation [AUC (W5-W8)] with improvement up to the minimal clinically relevant threshold of 10%: a 12.3% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort in the ITT population compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.0134) has been observed. In the IBS-C >= 2 subpopulation, there were a 13.1% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort and a 14.9% reduction of bloating compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.0194 and P = 0.0145, respectively). GI symptoms significantly decreased during supplementation but no statistical differences were reported between groups at the end of the supplementation period. Responder status was defined as a subject who experienced a decrease of 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.) or 50% of the abdominal discomfort score from baseline for at least 2 wk out of the last 4 wk of the study. A significant difference between groups was reported in the ITT population, when considering the first definition: subjects in the Active group had 1.510 higher odds to be a responder (reduction of 1 a.u. of abdominal pain/discomfort) compared with subjects in the Placebo group (P = 0.0240). At the end of supplementation period, stool consistency in the Active group of the ITT population was significantly improved and classified as ""normal"" compared to Placebo (respectively 3.13 +/- 1.197 a.u. vs 2.58 +/- 1.020 a.u., P = 0.0003). Similar results were seen in the IBS-C = 2 subpopulation (Active group: 3.14 +/- 1.219 a.u. vs Placebo group: 2.59 +/- 1.017 a.u., P = 0.0009). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis supports previous data linking S. cerevisiae I-3856 and improvement of GI symptoms, in IBS overall population and in the IBS-C and IBS-C = 2 subpopulations.

273,"AIM to evaluate the quality and accuracy of websites written to the public on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and assess their readability level. METHODS Google T, Bing T, and Yahoo T search engines were searched independently by three researchers in December 2014. Only English-language websites were selected on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Researchers independently evaluated the quality of each website by using the DISCERN and the HONcode instruments. The readability levels were calculated using two formulas; the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, and the Coleman-Liau Readability Index. The agreement between the evaluators was calculated using Cohen kappa coefficient. RESULTS eighty-four websites were finally identified. Scores varied from a minimum DISCERN score of 18 to a maximum of 68 [ mean +/- SD, 42.2 +/- 10.7; median = 41.5, interquartile range, interquartile range (IQR) = 15.8] and a minimum score of HONcode of 0.14 and a maximum of 0.95 (mean +/- SD, 0.16 +/- 0.19; median = 0.45, IQR = 0.29). Most of these websites were reviewed in 2014 and 2015 (n = 51). The creators of these websites were: universities and research centers (n = 25, 30%), foundations and associations (n = 15, 18%), commercial and pharmaceutical companies (n = 25, 30%), charities and volunteer work (n = 9, 10%), and non-university educational bodies (n = 10, 12%). The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score (mean +/- SD) was 11.9 +/- 2.4 and the Coleman-Liau Readability Index score was 12.6 +/- 1.5. Significant correlation was found between the two readability scores (R-2 = 0.509, p = 0.001). The overall agreement between evaluators measured by Cohen kappa coefficient was in the range of 0.804-0.876; rated as ""Good"". CONCLUSION The DISCERN and the HONcode scores of websites varied and the readability levels of most websites were above the public readability level. The study highlights the areas that need further improvement and development in patient education online materials about IBD.

Such intrinsic difficulties are, however, commonly encountered in many novel applications such as laser- and electron-beam-based additive manufacturing, human-machine interaction, etc. This paper provides a discrete-time regulation scheme for exact sampled-data rejection of disturbances beyond Nyquist frequency. By introducing a model-based multirate predictor and a forward-model disturbance observer, we show that the inter sample disturbances can be fully attenuated despite the limitations in sampling and sensing. The proposed control scheme offers several advantages in stability assurance and lucid design intuitions. Verification of the algorithm is conducted on a motion control platform that shares the general characteristics in several advanced manufacturing systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

275,"Aggregation of proteins is a physiological process which contributes to the pathophysiology of several maladies including diabetes mellitus, Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease. In this study we have reported that aloe emodin (AE), an anthroquinone, which is one of the active components of the Aloe vera plant, acts as an inhibitor of hemoglobin (Hb) aggregation. Hb was thermally aggregated at 60 degrees C for four days as evident by increased thioflavin T and ANS fluorescence, shifted congo red absorbance, appearance of beta sheet structure, increase in turbidity and presence of oligomeric aggregates. Increasing concentration of AE partially reverses the aggregation of the model heme protein (hemoglobin). The maximum effect of AE was observed at 100 mu M followed by saturation at 125 mu M. The results were confirmed by UV-visible spectrometry, intrinsic fluorescence, ThT, ANS, congo red assay as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These results were also supported by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) which shows the disappearance of beta sheet structure and appearance of a helices.

276,"A grid-connected inverter is indispensable for photovoltaic power generation and smart grid systems, and it must be designed for stable operation. The impedance method based on the Nyquist criterion is often utilized to analyze the stability of grid-connected inverter systems. The impedance method is based on the eigenvalues of the product of the inverter output admittance and the line impedance matrices in the frequency domain. However, the frequency characteristics have so far been derived only for inverters with analog control systems. A new frequency analysis method for inverters with digital control systems is proposed in this paper. First, a stability analysis example for a three-phase LCL-type inverter controlled digitally is shown and the results are compared and validated with those by simulation using a Saber simulator.

Here, we talk about what happened when a man with a learning disability had the therapy. We hope that other people will use the therapy too. This will improve therapy for people with learning disabilities. Abstract Background Joe was referred to the Community Learning Disabilities Team (CLDT) for support around low mood and overeating. Initial formulation suggested compassion focused therapy (CFT) as an intervention. The evidence base for using CFT with people with learning disabilities is currently limited. Materials and Methods Adaptations were made to the CFT framework, accounting for Joe's learning disability. A case study design was used to investigate the effectiveness of intervention. Joe attended 13 sessions of assessment, formulation and intervention. Client feedback was incorporated to assess suitability of the CFT approach and adaptations made. Results and Conclusions Changes in scores on outcome measures were limited. However, findings from this exploratory study suggest that CFT can be meaningfully adapted for use within the field of learning disabilities. Implications for clinical practice and directions for future research are discussed.

278,"An important problem in the field of bioinformatics is to identify interactive effects among profiled variables for outcome prediction. In this paper, a logistic regression model with pairwise interactions among a set of binary covariates is considered. Modeling the structure of the interactions by a graph, our goal is to recover the interaction graph from independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of the covariates and the outcome. When viewed as a feature selection problem, a simple quantity called influence is proposed as a measure of the marginal effects of the interaction terms on the outcome. For the case when the underlying interaction graph is known to be acyclic, it is shown that a simple algorithm that is based on a maximum-weight spanning tree with respect to the plug-in estimates of the influences not only has strong theoretical performance guarantees, but can also outperform generic feature selection algorithms for recovering the interaction graph from i.i.d. samples of the covariates and the outcome. Our results can also be extended to the model that includes both individual effects and pairwise interactions via the help of an auxiliary covariate.

279,"A longitudinal harvested rainwater quality monitoring study was undertaken at 6 sites within Selangor, Malaysia over a period of 8 months. Overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the Malaysian recreational water quality Class BB standards with exceptions for pH (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). A large number of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and Chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in Malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. Mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. Rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. Last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. The results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. Both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

280,"A hybrid power system uses many wind turbine generators (WTG) and solar photovoltaics (PV) in isolated small areas. However, the output power of these renewable sources is not constant and can diverge quickly, which has a serious effect on system frequency and the continuity of demand supply. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a new frequency control scheme for a hybrid power system to ensure supplying a high-quality power in isolated areas. The proposed power system consists of a WTG, PV, aqua-electrolyzer (AE), fuel cell (FC), battery energy storage system (BESS), flywheel (FW) and diesel engine generator (DEG). Furthermore, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) are implemented at the customer side. A full-order observer is utilized to estimate the supply error. Then, the estimated supply error is considered in a frequency domain. The high-frequency component is reduced by BESS and FW; while the low-frequency component of supply error is mitigated using FC, EV and DEG. Two PI controllers are implemented in the proposed system to control the system frequency and reduce the supply error. The epsilon multi-objective genetic algorithm (epsilon-MOGA) is applied to optimize the controllers' parameters. The performance of the proposed control scheme is compared with that of recent well-established techniques, such as a PID controller tuned by the quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA). The effectiveness and robustness of the hybrid power system are investigated under various operating conditions.

281,"A novel replacement for traditional wedgelocks used to mount PCB boards to cold plates is presented. This project began as part of a DARPA design competition to develop a field reversible thermal connector that could be repeatedly assembled and disassembled without the use of tools while providing constant thermal resistance. The team from UCLA was tasked with designing a new device to meet these constraints. The design meets the DARPA goals and significantly reduces the thermal resistance between the electrical board and the heat sink. The device consists of opposing aluminum wedges, driven by thermally actuated Nitinol springs, which slide against one another to provide the requisite locking force to hold a board in place and decrease contact resistance between the interfaces. These smart material springs push the wedges towards the outside of the device, elevating the upper surface and locking the board in place on the cold plate. The design increases the contact area between the components and decreases the thermal resistance relative to current devices. Experimental results have shown that the UCLA team has addressed the chief design problems posed by the REVCON program. Nitinol has been shown to be an effective material for use as a thermally actuated spring capable of repeatedly engaging and disengaging without the use of tools. The wedge locking force increases with rising temperature, enhancing its thermal performance. The UCLA design has been shown to out-perform similar sized current state of the art wedgelock designs in terms of thermal resistance. Reductions in thermal resistance of 30%-45% have been demonstrated and shown to be repeatable. Our prototype design increases the interfacial contact area which has a dramatic impact on performance. This means that higher power density electronics can be utilized or that more real estate will be made available on current computer boards in order to maintain current performance. Further, the use of thermally actuated leaf springs removes the need for mechanical force for installation allowing for less installation time.

283,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is strongly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In several mouse models of AD, it was shown that adult -born neurons exhibit reduced survival and altered synaptic integration due to a severe lack of dendritic spines. In the present work, using the APPxPS1 mouse model of AD, we reveal that this reduced number of spines is concomitant of a marked deficit in their neuronal mitochondrial content. Remarkably, we show that targeting the overexpression of the pro -neural transcription factor Neurodl into APPxPS1 adult -born neurons restores not only their dendritic spine density, but also their mitochondrial content and the proportion of spines associated with mitochondria. Using primary neurons, a bona fide model of neuronal maturation, we identified that increases of mitochondrial respiration accompany the stimulating effect of Neurodl overexpression on dendritic growth and spine formation. Reciprocally, pharmacologically impairing mitochondria prevented Neurodl-dependent trophic effects. Thus, since overexpression of Neurodl into new neurons of APPxPS1 mice rescues spatial memory, our present data suggest that manipulating the mitochondrial system of adult -born hippocampal neurons provides neuronal plasticity to the AD brain. These findings open new avenues for far-reaching therapeutic implications towards neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive impairment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

285,"As a new delivery mode, integrated project delivery (IPD) relies on highly trust-based collaboration among project parties. Thus, selecting the appropriate parties is important for successful IPD. Although traditional selection methods, which are primarily based on only the lowest tender price or multiple criteria other than price, can help select parties that can complete an integrated project, they are not completely suitable for IPD when trust and collaborative relationship among the project parties are considered. To improve upon this shortcoming of established methods, a new method based on the concept of an interorganizational transactive memory system (I-TMS) is established in this paper. The I-TMS drives group members to be mutually trusting and cooperatively integrate their professional knowledge, which reflects the idea of collaboration that underlies IPD. In this study, party selection for IPD was achieved via two processes. First, this study developed an I-TMS rating scale and conducted a questionnaire-based analysis to verify its reliability and validity quantitatively. Second, this study selected an appropriate combination from seven combinations of party candidates. In addition, this study analyzed the appropriate combination using social network analysis (SNA). The results suggest that project parties with a low I-TMS degree should engage in frequent interaction to foster mutual cognition and trust and improve team collaboration for IPD.

The influence of different monocarboxylic acids on the viscosities of polyesters and their 2K-PU films hardness was studied and it was found that MHPs prepared from lauric acid displayed the higher films hardness and lower viscosities. IR spectra of MHPs disclosed the ring-opening reaction between epsilon-caprolactone and hydroxyl groups occurred. H-1 NMR spectra demonstrated that the molecular structures of MHPs were irregular due to the multiplicity of reaction processes.

291,"A mental health trial is analyzed using a dose-response model, in which the number of sessions attended by the patients is deemed indicative of the dose of psychotherapeutic treatment. Here, the parameter of interest is the difference in causal treatment effects between the subpopulations that take part in different numbers of therapy sessions. For this data set, interactions between random treatment allocation and prognostic baseline variables provide the requisite instrumental variables. While the corresponding two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimator tends to have smaller bias than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator; the TSLS suffers from larger variance. It is therefore appealing to combine the desirable properties of the OLS and TSLS estimators. Such a trade-off is achieved through an affine combination of these two estimators, using mean squared error as a criterion. This produces the semi-parametric Stein-like (SPSL) estimator as introduced by Judge and Mittelhammer (2004). The SPSL estimator is used in conjunction with multiple imputation with chained equations, to provide an estimator that can exploit all available information. Simulated data are also generated to illustrate the superiority of the SPSL estimator over its OLS and TSLS counterparts.

292,"Affine equivalence classification of Boolean functions has significant applications in logic synthesis and cryptography. Previous studies for classification have been limited by the large set of Boolean functions and the complex operations on the affine group. Although there are many research on affine equivalence classification for parts of Boolean functions in recent years, there are very few results for the entire set of Boolean functions. The best existing result has been achieved by Harrison with 15768919 affine equivalence classes for 6-variable Boolean functions. This paper presents a concise formula for affine equivalence classification of the entire set of Boolean functions as well as a formula for affine classification of Boolean functions with distinct ON-set size respectively. The method outlined in this paper greatly simplifies the affine group's action by constructing an isomorphism mapping from the affine group to a permutation group. By this method, we can compute the affine equivalence classes for up to 10 variables. Experiment results indicate that our scheme for calculating the affine equivalence classes for more than 6 variables is a significant advancement over previous published methods.

301,"A series of zinc-phosphate glass containing different concentrations of V2O5 ((80 - x) NaPO3 + 20 ZnO + x V2O5 (x = 0-25 mol%)) was prepared by melt quenching method and analyzed by differential scanning caloremetry (DSC) and impredance spectroscopy. The electrical properties of these samples were measured using ac impedance spectroscopy technique over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 13 MHz at several temperatures in the range of 323-673 K. The ac conductivity, dc conductivity, dielectric constant and loss factors were obtained from these measurements. Constant-phase elements (CPE) are used in equivalent electrical circuits for the fitting of experimental impedance data. The impedance spectra have also indicated that the conduction is predominantly polaronic in nature. The frequency and temperature dependence of the electrical modulis as well as dielectric loss parameters have exhibited a relaxation character attributed to the vanadyl complexes. The relaxation effects have been analyzed by the graphical method. From this analysis, it has been established that there is a spread of relaxation times. The results have been further discussed quantitatively in the light of different valance states of vanadium ions with the aid of the data on spectroscopic properties. The frequency dependence of the electric conductivity was found to follow a simple power law behavior, in accordance with the relation sigma(ac)(omega) = sigma(0) + Lambda(1).omega(s)(2), where s(1) and s(2) are smaller than 1. The thermal activation energies for the electronic conduction were estimated on the basis of the Arrhenius plots. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

302,"A study was carried out to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET) over a 1074 km(2) of the humid area of Perak State (Malaysia), where water and evaporation cycle deeply influences the climate, natural resources and human living aspects. Images from both Terra and Aqua platforms of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor were used for ET estimation by employing the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. As a part of the accuracy assessment process, in-situ measurements on soil temperature and reference ET (ET0) were recorded at the time of satellite overpass. In order to enhance the accuracy of the generated ET maps, MODIS images were subjected to sub-pixel analysis by assigning weights for different land surface cover (urban, agriculture and multi-surface areas) reflections. The weighting process was achieved by integrating ET from pure pixels with the respective site-specific ET0 of each land cover. The enhanced SEBAL model estimated ET exhibited a good correlation with the in-situ measured Penman-Montieth ET0, with R-2 values for the Aqua and the Terra platforms of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. However, the correlation of the non-enhanced ET maps resulted in R-2 values of 0.61 and 0.68 for the Aqua and the Terra platforms, respectively. Hence, the results of this study revealed the feasibility of employing the sub-pixel analysis method for an accurate estimation of ET over large areas.

303,"Advances in energy harvesting systems are needed to power wireless sensors for structural health monitoring. Research on developing a harvesting system that converts the low frequency, non-periodic, and low-acceleration vibrations present on bridges is continued and significantly extended in this work. The mechanics of the harvester were optimized to increase its robustness and lifetime, power electronics were added, and the complete system was installed on the New Carquinez suspension bridge in California. The complete results and analysis are presented in this study. The power management circuit is added to rectify and boost the low AC output of the harvester and convert it into a usable DC voltage. The harvester design is further enhanced to significantly improve performance and robustness. During short-term on-bridge testing, the system was able to charge a 10 mu F capacitor to 2V DC, and the average harvester output power ranges from 1.6 to 5.0 mu W, depending on the location on the bridge, a 10x improvement over previous results. A long-term test of the harvesting system has been conducted, during which the performance of the system was monitored remotely using a wireless sensor network. The system improvements described in this study enabled continuous operation in the harsh bridge environment for 13 months starting April 30, 2012 and constitute a major milestone in the development of miniaturized motion harvesters.

304,"A new multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC-SubSim, has recently appeared that exploits the Subset Simulation method for efficient rare-event simulation. ABC-SubSim adaptively creates a nested decreasing sequence of data-approximating regions in the output space that correspond to increasingly closer approximations of the observed output vector in this output space. At each level, multiple samples of the model parameter vector are generated by a component-wise Metropolis algorithm so that the predicted output corresponding to each parameter value falls in the current data-approximating region. Theoretically, if continued to the limit, the sequence of data-approximating regions would converge on to the observed output vector and the approximate posterior distributions, which are conditional on the data approximation region, would become exact, but this is not practically feasible. In this paper we study the performance of the ABC-SubSim algorithm for Bayesian updating of the parameters of dynamical systems using a general hierarchical state-space model. We note that the ABC methodology gives an approximate posterior distribution that actually corresponds to an exact posterior where a uniformly distributed combined measurement and modeling error is added. We also note that ABC algorithms have a problem with learning the uncertain error variances in a stochastic state-space model and so we treat them as nuisance parameters and analytically integrate them out of the posterior distribution. In addition, the statistical efficiency of the original ABC-SubSim algorithm is improved by developing a novel strategy to regulate the proposal variance for the component-wise Metropolis algorithm at each level. We demonstrate that Self-regulated ABC-SubSim is well suited for Bayesian system identification by first applying it successfully to model updating of a two degree-of-freedom linear structure for three cases: globally, locally and unidentifiable model classes, and then to model updating of a two degree-of-freedom nonlinear structure with Duffing nonlinearities in its interstory force-deflection relationship.

305,"A novel amphiphilic hydroquinone derivative having a C18 alkyl chain phosphate attached to the hydroquinone (HQ) moiety was chemically synthesized. The thermal stability, distribution between organic and aqueous phases, and in vitro skin permeability were evaluated. This HQ derivative was identified as disodium p-phenylene diisostearyl diphosphate (HQ-2P2IS) by UV, infrared, mass, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Product HQ-2P2IS was obtained in good yield (56%), and it exhibited satisfactory stability in neutral solution, comparable to that of HQ. Its skin permeability was also higher than that of HQ. HQ-2P2IS is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by tissue phosphatase, which releases HQ in the skin tissues. Thus, these characteristics indicate that the novel hydroquinone derivative presented herein, i.e., HQ-2P2IS, may serve as an effective pro-hydroquinone for skin care applications.

311,"Aiming at improving the poor real-time performance of existing nonlinear filtering algorithms applied to spacecraft autonomous navigation based on Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements and simplifying the algorithm design of navigation algorithms, a spacecraft autonomous navigation algorithm based on polytopic linear differential inclusion is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it is demonstrated that the nonlinear estimation error system of spacecraft autonomous navigation can be modelled as a polytopic linear differential inclusion system model according to the idea of global linearization. Thus, the filtering of a nonlinear system simplified to a filtering of a polytopic linear system with coefficients. Secondly, Tensor-Product (TP) model transformation is applied to determine the polytopic linear differential inclusion system model. The model error introduced by global linearization is reduced and the compromise between computational complexity and modelling accuracy is realised. Finally, a spacecraft autonomous navigation algorithm based on polytopic linear differential inclusion is designed by combining multi-model Kalman filtering with data fusion. Compared with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the proposed algorithm is simpler and easier to implement since it need not update the Jacobian matrices online. Simulation results demonstrate the same estimation accuracy of the proposed algorithm to that of EKF.

However, CBT is associated with significant patient dropout and lacks the means to provide objective data regarding a patient's experience and symptoms between sessions. Emerging wearables and mobile health (mHealth) applications represent an approach that may provide objective data to the patient and provider between CBT sessions. Here, we describe the development of a classifier of real-time physiological stress in a healthy population (n = 35) and apply it in a controlled clinical evaluation for armed forces veterans undergoing CBT for stress and anger management (n = 16). Using cardiovascular and electrodermal inputs from a wearable device, the classifier was able to detect physiological stress in a non-clinical sample with accuracy greater than 90%. In a small clinical sample, patients who used the classifier and an associated mHealth application were less likely to discontinue therapy (p = 0.016, d = 1.34) and significantly improved on measures of stress (p = 0.032, d = 1.61), anxiety (p = 0.050, d = 1.26), and anger (p = 0.046, d = 1.41) compared to controls undergoing CBT alone. Given the large number of individuals that experience mental health disorders and the unmet need for treatment, especially in developing nations, such mHealth approaches have the potential to provide or augment treatment at low cost in the absence of in-person care.

Development of methods for removal of arsenic contamination from the drinking water will be of great importance for the mankind.

Bacteria were isolated from water sample by enrichment culture technique and based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences, isolates tolerating 150mM arsenate/As(V) were identified as Paracoccus sp strain NC-A and Alcaligenes faecalis strain NC-B, whereas isolate resistant to 30mM arsenite/As(lll) was identified as Stenotrophomonas sp. strain NC-C. Bioinformatic analysis of genome of reference strains revealed the presence of different arsenic resistance (ars) genes. Arsenic removal efficiency of isolates was evaluated and it was observed that As(V) resistant strains of Paracoccus and Alcaligenes removed up to 84.5% and 93% arsenic, respectively from the external growth medium, whereas, As(111) resistant strain of Stenotrophomonas sp. removed 79.6% arsenic from the culture broth. The optimum pH, temperature and nutrient levels (peptone water) for arsenic removal by these isolates were 7.0, 35 degrees C and (PW/60), respectively. These observations suggest that the strains described in this study are capable of removing arsenic from the dilute solutions, and hence being natural isolates, these strains can be easily used in the purification of arsenic contaminated water and thereby check the increasing arsenic toxicity in human food chain.

The unscented.

316,"A novel label-free system for the sensitive fluorescent detection of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) activity has been developed by utilizing DNA-templated silver nanocluster/graphene oxide (DNA-AgNC/GO) nanocomposite. AgNC is first synthesized around C-rich template DNA and the resulting DNA-AgNC binds to GO through the interaction between the extension DNA and GO. The resulting DNA-AgNC/GO would show quite reduced fluorescence signal because the fluorescence from DNA-AgNCs is quenched by GO. In the presence of DNase I, however, it degrades the DNA strand within DNA/RNA hybrid duplex probe employed in this study, consequently releasing RNA which is complementary to the extension DNA. The released free RNA then extracts DNA-AgNC from GO by hybridizing with the extension DNA bound to GO. This process would restore the quenched fluorescence, emitting highly enhanced fluorescence signal. By employing this assay principle, DNase I activity was reliably identified with a detection limit of 0.10 U/ml which is lower than those from previous fluorescence-based methods. Finally, the practical capability of this assay system was successfully demonstrated by its use to determine DNase I activity in bovine urine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There are many different systems for monitoring individuals wearing such devices, and these electronic anklet monitoring systems commonly detect violations of circulation areas permitted to holders. In spite of being able to monitor individual localization, such systems do not identify grouping activities of the monitored individuals, although this kind of event could represent a real risk of further offenses planned by those individuals. In order to address such a problem and to help monitoring systems to be able to have a proactive approach, this paper proposes sensor data fusion algorithms that are able to identify such groups based on data provided by anklet positioning devices.

The proposed algorithms are validated in various serial and parallel computing scenarios, and the correspondent results are presented and discussed. The information produced by the proposed algorithms yields to a better characterization of the monitored individuals and can be adapted to support decision-making systems used by authorities that are responsible for planning decisions regarding actions affecting public security.

Our aims were to evaluate whether: (a) the circulating concentrations of leptin, ghrelin and BDNF in CD patients were different from those in healthy subjects; (b) GFD might induce changes in their levels; (c) BDNF Val66Met polymorphism variability might affect BDNF levels; and (d) serum BDNF levels were related to dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a neurotrophin modulator. Nineteen adult coeliac patients and 21 healthy controls were included. A QoL questionnaire was administered, and serum concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, BDNF and red blood cell membrane DHA levels were determined at the enrolment and after 1 year of GFD. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was analysed. Results from the questionnaire indicated a decline in QoL after GFD. Ghrelin and leptin levels were not significantly different between groups.

Using the 28-item general health questionnaire, the Zung self-rating depression scale (Zung-SDS), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the Spielberger state-trait-anxiety-inventory (STAI), physical and mental state of the LOW students were compared with those of 30 students who reported their parental bonding as optimal (OPT; high care and low overprotection).

Among glucocorticoid-related genes examined (GR, ADRB2, IB, IL10, IL1R2, IL1RN, MR, MC2R, TGFB1, TGFB2 and FASLG), real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed that the LOW students significantly increased expression of a dominant negative glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and decreased 2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) mRNA levels in circulating leukocytes.

The proposed switched fractional controller (SFC) consists of a conventional PI controller, a fractional order PI (FO-PI) controller and a decision maker that switches between them. Commonly, the conventional PI controller is used in regulation loops due to its advantages in steady-state but it is limited in transient state. On the other hand, the FO-PI controller overcomes these drawbacks but it causes dramatic degradation in control performances in steady-state because of the fractional calculus theory and the approximation method used to implement this kind of controller. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to switch to the PI controller in steady-state to obtain the best power quality and to switch to the FO-PI controller when external disturbances are detected to guarantee a fast transient state.

Overall, it offers the same excellent dynamic performance of the analog hysteresis controller and, at the same time, solves most of the related problems.

331,"A unique cogeneration system integrating a biogas fed Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a Concentrating Solar Thermal (CST) system for a reference Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Italy is proposed. Biogas which is locally in the WWTP from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of the collected sludge can be used to produce electricity using SOFC power modules. The thermal power recovered from the SOFC exhaust stream is used to meet part of the digester thermal load. However, the rest heat loads are provided by using the integration with the CST system and an auxiliary boiler. Energy analysis is performed to determine the effect of using the solar heating system on the system performance. Also, the economic performance is evaluated through a cash-flow analysis and the calculation of the Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). It is observed that installing 300 m(2), 700 m(2), 1100 m(2) of solar collectors could cover 8%, 18% and 30% of total digester heat load, respectively. Results show an overall beneficial effect of the solar installation, both from an energy and economic standpoint of view. For all the scenarios analyzed, the LCOE is lower than the grid electricity price and, with increasing solar integration, the value is further reduced showing that, despite the investment return time, the electricity production during the entire system lifetime is competitive against grid electricity prices.

332,"A model for hepatitis C is formulated to study the effects of treatment and public concern on HCV transmission dynamics. The stability of equilibria and persistence of the model are analyzed, and an optimal control measure is performed to prevent the spread of HCV with minimal infected individuals and cost. The dynamical analysis reveals that the disease-free equilibrium of the model is asymptotically stable if the basic reproductive number R-0 is less than unity. On the other hand, if R-0 >1, the disease is uniformly persistent. Numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the influence of different vital parameters on R-0. For the corresponding optimality system, the optimal solution is discussed by Pontryagin Maximum Principle, and the comparisons of model-predicted consequences with control or not are presented.

333,"Aging is associated with a progressive loss of the CD28 costimulatory molecule in CD4(+) lymphocytes (CD28(null) T cells), which is accompanied by the acquisition of new biological and functional properties that give rise to an impaired immune response. The regulatory mechanisms that govern the appearance and function of this cell subset during aging and in several associated inflammatory disorders remain controversial. Here, we present the whole-genome DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of CD28(null) T cells and its CD28(+) counterpart. A comparative analysis revealed that 296 genes are differentially methylated between the two cell subsets. A total of 160 genes associated with cytotoxicity (e.g. GRZB, TYROBP, and RUNX3) and cytokine/chemokine signaling (e.g. CX3CR1, CD27, and IL-1R) are demethylated in CD28(null) T cells, while 136 de novo-methylated genes matched defects in the TCR signaling pathway (e.g. ITK, TXK, CD3G, and LCK). TCR-landscape analysis confirmed that CD28(null) T cells have an oligo/monoclonal expansion over the polyclonal background of CD28(+) T cells, but feature a V family repertoire specific to each individual. We reported that CD28(null) T cells show a preactivation state characterized by a higher level of expression of inflammasome-related genes that leads to the release of IL-1 when activated. Overall, our results demonstrate that CD28(null) T cells have a unique DNA methylation landscape, which is associated with differences in gene expression, contributing to the functionality of these cells. Understanding these epigenetic regulatory mechanisms could suggest novel therapeutic strategies to prevent the accumulation and activation of these cells during aging.

334,"A body of evidence has implicated dietary deficiency in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the pathophysiology and etiology of recurrent mood disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder. Cross-national and cross-sectional evidence suggests that greater habitual intake of n-3 PUFA is associated with reduced risk for developing mood symptoms. Meta-analyses provide strong evidence that patients with mood disorders exhibit low blood n-3 PUFA levels which are associated with increased risk for the initial development of mood symptoms in response to inflammation. While the etiology of this n-3 PUFA deficit may be multifactorial, n-3 PUFA supplementation is sufficient to correct this deficit and may also have antidepressant effects. Rodent studies suggest that n-3 PUFA deficiency during perinatal development can recapitulate key neuropathological, neurochemical, and behavioral features associated with mood disorders. Clinical neuroimaging studies suggest that low n-3 PUFA biostatus is associated with abnormalities in cortical structure and function also observed in mood disorders. Collectively, these findings implicate dietary n-3 PUFA insufficiency, particularly during development, in the pathophysiology of mood dysregulation, and support implementation of routine screening for and treatment of n-3 PUFA deficiency in patients with mood disorders.

335,"A set of 96 open-cell foams with growing porosities (035-0.95) and growing pore nominal diameters (0.4-2.6 mm) was artificially generated to firmly connect their normal spectral emittances to their textural features. This work is strictly focused on foams that are composed of opaque struts with optically smooth surfaces. To compute the normal spectral emittances, a Monte Carlo Ray Tracing code was carefully used through an indirect method based on Kirchhoff's laws. The Monte Carlo Ray Tracing code considers the complex refractive index of the solid phase constituting the struts foams. Particular attention is therefore paid to performing the calculation with absorption indices (0.5-8) that preserve the opacity of each strut. From a thorough analysis of the ray transport within all the foams, Where the Representative Elementary Volumes used for computing the homogenized radiative properties were known beforehand, a general and simple law is established that connects the normal spectral emittance, on the one hand, and the open porosity and the complex index of refraction, on the other hand. In the field of the thermal conversion of solar energy, for example, the new law gives relevant insight on the radiative performance of highly porous foams that are virtually coated with materials that are known for possessing an undeniable spectral selectivity when they are shaped as dense samples.

The echo signals of the simultaneous bidirectional link are cancelled by controlling the decision level of receiver comparators without power-hungry operational amplifier (op-amp) based circuits. With the clock information embedded in the rising edges of the signals sent from the source side to the sink side, the data is recovered by an open-loop digital circuit with 20 times blind oversampling. The data rate of the simultaneous bidirectional transceiver in each direction is 75 Mbps and therefore the overall signaling bandwidth is 150 Mbps. The measured energy efficiency of the transceiver is 56.7 pJ/b and the bit-error-rate (BER) is less than 10(-12) with 2(7)-1 pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) pattern for both signaling directions.

341,"A gastrointestinal parasite survey of 411 stray and refuge dogs sampled from four geographical and climactically distinct locations in India revealed these animals to represent a significant source of environmental contamination for parasites that pose a zoonotic risk to the public. Hookworms were the most commonly identified parasite in dogs in Sikkim (71.3%), Mumbai (48.8%) and Delhi (39.1%). In Ladakh, which experiences harsh extremes in climate, a competitive advantage was observed for parasites such as Sarcocystis spp. (44.2%), Taenia hydatigena (30.3%) and Echinococcus granulosus (2.3%) that utilise intermediate hosts for the completion of their life cycle. PCR identified Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Ancylostoma caninum to occur sympatrically, either as single or mixed infections in Sikkim (Northeast) and Mumbai (West). In Delhi, A. caninum was the only species identified in dogs, probably owing to its ability to evade unfavourable climatic conditions by undergoing arrested development in host tissue. The expansion of the known distribution of A. ceylanicum to the west, as far as Mumbai, justifies the renewed interest in this emerging zoonosis and advocates for its surveillance in future human parasite surveys. Of interest was the absence of Trichuris vulpis in dogs, in support of previous canine surveys in India. This study advocates the continuation of birth control programmes in stray dogs that will undoubtedly have spill-over effects on reducing the levels of environmental contamination with parasite stages. In particular, owners of pet animals exposed to these environments must be extra vigilant in ensuring their animals are regularly dewormed and maintaining strict standards of household and personal hygiene.

343,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of energy-limited autonomous tiny devices spatially distributed so as to monitor their environments. They have a very wide application domain ranging from military applications to health care services, logistics, or agriculture. Efficient use of sensor energies and network security are of utmost importance, given their possible application domains and operational properties. Multipath routing and multi-copy forwarding are well-known approaches shown to be useful against several threats. In this paper we study the design of an energy-efficient and reliable WSN. We discuss four different routing strategies with multipath routing and various levels of multi-copying, namely, the no, full, and partial redundancy cases. Moreover, we incorporate balanced energy dissipation in our models not only to improve network lifetime, which is the time until the first sensor in the network exhausts its energy, but also to eliminate critical nodes, which are appealing for malicious attacks. We construct mathematical models of all these protocols and present some test results so as to display the trade-off between energy efficiency and network reliability. We compare their performance in terms of network lifetime and the amount of data successfully transmitted in case of an inconvenience. The full data redundancy protocol yields a more reliable design than the balanced utilization with no redundancy or the partial redundancy protocols in exchange for a quite significant degradation in network lifetime. However, the partial redundancy protocol provides a slightly less reliable WSN than the full redundancy case with almost 60% longer lifetime. As a result, we can suggest that our partial multi-copy protocol with extended balanced utilization rule is quite favourable for operating networks energy efficiently and securely.

The impact of this event on ambient PM10 surface levels and its spatial and temporal evolution was investigated by means of data from 250 air quality stations across mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. The event had a significant impact on surface PM10 levels, and on 22 February, 90% of the air quality monitoring sites registered PM10 concentrations above the EU daily limit value of 50g/m(3). The study of the attenuated backscattering vertical profiles associated with African dust evidenced a complex structure, with a thick aerosol layer that was at higher altitudes over the pre-Pyrenees compared to the coastal area of Barcelona but closer to the surface than typically observed at both sites. Optical and physical properties of dust particles were investigated at the continental background Global Atmosphere Watch mountain observatory of Montsec (MSA) in the pre-Pyrenees. Good agreement was found between in situ and passive remote sensing methodologies once the aloft dust layer reached the MSA station. Scattering angstrom ngstrom exponent values decreased to values close to zero (even below zero for surface in situ measurements) indicating the predominance of coarse particles. On the contrary, absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent values increased during the Saharan dust outbreak denoting an absorption enhancement at shorter wavelengths, characteristic of mineral dust particles. Furthermore, the performance of NMMB/BSC-Dust and BSC-DREAM8b models has been qualitatively evaluated for the dust spatial distribution across Spain and the vertical structure over MSA and Barcelona showing good agreement.

We found the estimations of the incidence of MRSA infections varied widely depending upon the type of population studied, the types of infections captured and in the definitions and terminology used to describe the results. We could not find definitive evidence that the incidence of MRSA infections in U.S. community or facilities is decreasing significantly. Of concern are recent data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) on MRSA bloodstream infections which indicate that by the end of 2015 there had been little change in the average facility Standardized Infection Ratio (0.988), compared to a 2010-2011 baseline and is significantly increased compared to the previous year. This is in contradistinction to the recent Veterans Administration study which reported over an 80% reduction in MRSA infections. However, this discrepancy may be due to the inability to reconcile the baselines of the two data sets; and the observed increase may be artifactual due to aberrations in the NHSN tracking system. Our review supports the need for implementation of a comprehensive tracking and monitoring system involving all types of healthcare facilities for multi-drug resistant organisms, along with concomitant funding for both staff and infrastructure.

Systematic formulations of state-space equations as well as a new switch model are presented. The proposed switch model exhibits a natural switching behavior, which is a valuable characteristic for the real-time simulation of power converters, thereby allowing individual treatment of switching devices irrespective of the converter topology. Successful implementations of the proposed switch model on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device are reported, with two alternative approaches: 1) precomputing network equations for all switch state combinations and 2) solving network equations on-chip using the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. A two-level three-phase voltage source converter is implemented using the first approach, with a time step of 80 ns and a switching frequency of 200 kHz. Ideal and nonideal boost converters are also implemented on FPGA using the second approach, with a time step of 75 ns and a switching frequency of 20 kHz. Comparison with SPICE models shows that the proposed switch model offers very satisfactory accuracy and precision.

Considering the consolidation of the internet and the improvement of the interaction, searching, and learning mechanisms, we propose a generic architecture, called CaVa, to create virtual Learning Spaces building up on cultural institution documents. More precisely, our proposal is to automatically create ontology-based virtual learning environments. Thus, to impart relevant learning materials to the virtual LS, we propose the use of ontologies to represent the key concepts and semantic relations in an user- and machine-understandable format. These concepts together with the data (extracted from the real documents) stored in a digital storage format (XML datasets, relational databases, etc.) are displayed in an ontology-based learning space that enables the visitors to use the available features and tools to learn about a specific domain. According to the approach here discussed, each desired virtual LS must be specified rigorously through a domain specific language (DSL) that was designed and implemented. To validate the proposed architecture, three case studies will be used as instances of CaVa architecture. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

348,"A frequently occurring subcircuit consists of a loop of a resistor (R), a field-effect transistor (FET), and a capacitor (C). The FET acts as a switch, controlled at its gate terminal by a clock voltage. There may be many such identical circuits connected in parallel, each driven by a different phase of the clock. This subcircuit may be acting as a sample-and-hold (S/H), as a passive mixer (P-M), or as a bandpass filter or bandpass impedance. In this work, we will present a useful analysis that leads to a simple signal flow graph (SFG), which captures the FET-R-C circuit's action completely across a wide range of design parameters. The SFG dissects the circuit into three filtering functions and ideal sampling. This greatly simplifies analysis of frequency response, noise, input impedance, and conversion gain, and leads to guidelines for optimum design. The analysis is extended to multi- path realizations common in RF applications. Part I of this paper focuses on the analyses of a single-path FET-R-C circuit's signal transfer characteristics. Part II extends these analyses to multi- path FET-R-C circuit configurations, which is followed by the noise and driving-point impedance analyses.

The obtained results correlated well with the ELISA used in the clinic for assaying glucose-stimulated insulin release from donor islets. We anticipate that this type of sensor can be applied as a rapid point-of-use biosensor to assess the quality of donor islets in terms of their insulin production efficiency, prior to transplantation.

The maximum increase in the integral uniformity was 3% when using a gradient echo MRI sequence while the mean differential uniformity when inside the MRI increased by 1%. Spatial resolution varied in a predictable manner from 2.4 mm FWHM at the collimator face to 6.9 mm at 10 cm from the collimator. Performance of the 3 T GE Discovery MR750 using a 16-channel breast RF coil array was measured with and without the gamma camera present using a gradient echo and spoiled gradient echo imaging sequence. A realistic 99mTc-filled breast-like phantom containing two lesions (30: 1 lesion to background ratio) was used to assess the feasibility of both serial and simultaneous hybrid imaging. Sequential imaging resulted in a reduction in MRI SNR of 70-80% and a further decrease of 93-98% was observed when performing simultaneous MR/scintigraphy imaging, likely a result of RF interference originating from the CZT detector modules and associated analog electronics. Co-registered scintigraphic and MRI images display negligible geometric distortion when imaged with both simultaneous and serial imaging modes, thus indicating the feasibility of combining MBI with breast MRI.

During the initial stage of corrosion, pure Ni and GH4033 gain weight from the many plate-like shells formed on the sample surface. After corrosion for 40 h, all sample surfaces were rather porous and loosened. MgO nuclei that were attached to the loosened microstructure surface fell off with the microstructures, which led to a continual decrease in the sample weight.

The experimental results showed that the P(MMA-co-MAA) hydrogels assume a three-networks architecture in morphologies, and that nearly spherical Ag nanoparticles are formed in these hydrogel networks; the size of these Ag nanoparticles varies with the system composition. The swelling kinetics investigations demonstrated that the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR) of the P(MMA-co-MAA)/Ag hydrogels depended on the content of the MAA and pH of the buffer solutions, and the ESR values were reduced with increasing MAA contents. The antibacterial properties against both S. aureus and B. subtilis bacteria demonstrated that the P(MMA-co-MAA)/silver nanocomposite hydrogels had higher antimicrobial efficacy than the pure P(MMA-co-MAA) counterparts. Therefore, the nanocomposite hydrogels turned out to be a potentially smart material in the range of applications of antibacterial activity.

362,"An exciting paradise of data is emerging into our daily life along with the development of relative perceptive technologies in smart home. How to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. This paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (ERAR). The ERAR approach segments data flow based on AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on SVM model. The AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (AES) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. Experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our ERAR approach performs better than the baseline approaches.

363,"Achieving efficient security solutions for wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a daring challenge due to vulnerable nature of wireless medium. Routing is a major threat to security. An adversary can inject bogus routing to en-route nodes causing false decision and drain the sensors energy in the network system. To identify and prune the adversaries, pruning route modifiers (PRM) algorithm based on the collaborative authentication system has been proposed. The algorithm considers the random deployment of sensor nodes. Based on the collaborative authentication scheme, the PRM algorithm can save energy by pruning the malicious nodes at early stage. The simulation results and theoretical analysis reveals that PRM algorithm is effective in terms of efficient and secure routing. This algorithm reduces the consumption of energy by pruning and establishes the shortest path that leads to efficient network and enables security.

The test environment is planned to be utilized for developing and validating the algorithms for formation flying capability in real environment as well as for education purpose. An already existing test bed for single quadrocopter was extended with necessary inter-communication and distributed control mechanism to test the algorithms for formation flights in 2 degrees of freedom (roll/pitch). This study encompasses the domain of communication, control engineering and embedded systems programming. Bluetooth protocol has been used for inter-communication between two quadrocopters. A simple approach of PID control in combination with Kalman filter has been exploited. MATLAB Instrument Control Toolbox has been used for data display, plotting and analysis. Plots can be drawn in real-time and received information can also be stored in the form of files for later use and analysis. The test setup has been developed indigenously and at considerably low cost. Emphasis has been placed on simplicity to facilitate students learning process. Several lessons have been learnt during the course of development of this setup. Proposed setup is quite flexible that can be modified as per changing requirements.

365,"A tangent vector field on a surface is the generator of a smooth family of maps from the surface to itself, known as the flow. Given a scalar function on the surface, it can be transported, or advected, by composing it with a vector field's flow. Such transport is exhibited by many physical phenomena, e.g., in fluid dynamics. In this paper, we are interested in the inverse problem: given source and target functions, compute a vector field whose flow advects the source to the target. We propose a method for addressing this problem, by minimizing an energy given by the advection constraint together with a regularizing term for the vector field. Our approach is inspired by a similar method in computational anatomy, known as LDDMM, yet leverages the recent framework of functional vector fields for discretizing the advection and the flow as operators on scalar functions. The latter allows us to efficiently generalize LDDMM to curved surfaces, without explicitly computing the flow lines of the vector field we are optimizing for. We show two approaches for the solution: using linear advection with multiple vector fields, and using non-linear advection with a single vector field. We additionally derive an approximated gradient of the corresponding energy, which is based on a novel vector field transport operator. Finally, we demonstrate applications of our machinery to intrinsic symmetry analysis, function interpolation and map improvement.

366,"A longstanding debate exists in population policy about the relationship between modern contraception and abortion. Although theory predicts that they should be substitutes, the empirical evidence is difficult to interpret. What is required is a large-scale intervention that alters the supply (or full price) of one or the other and, importantly, that does so in isolation (reproductive health programs often bundle primary health care and family planning-and in some instances, abortion services). In this article, we study Nepal's 2004 legalization of abortion provision and subsequent expansion of abortion services, an unusual and rapidly implemented policy meeting these requirements. Using four waves of rich individual-level data representative of fertile-age Nepalese women, we find robust evidence of substitution between modern contraception and abortion. This finding has important implications for public policy and foreign aid, suggesting that an effective strategy for reducing expensive and potentially unsafe abortions may be to expand the supply of modern contraceptives.

Proposals for switching to a saving-for-retirement system that does not rely on high payroll taxes have been challenged on the grounds that welfare would fall for some groups such as retirees or the working poor. We show how to devise a transition path from the current U.S. system to a saving-for-retirement system that increases the welfare of all current and future generations, with estimates of future gains higher than those found in typically used macroeconomic models. The gains are large because there is more productive capital than commonly assumed. Our quantitative results depend importantly on accounting for differences between actual government tax revenues and what revenues would be if all income were taxed at the income-weighted average marginal tax rates used in our analysis.

Despite the advances in our understanding of its pathobiology, the chemotherapy-directed management has remained largely unchanged in the past 40 years. However, various novel agents have demonstrated clinical activity, either as single agents (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors, vadastuximab) or in combination with standard induction/consolidation at diagnosis and with salvage regimens at relapse. The classes of agents described in this review include novel cytotoxic chemotherapies (CPX-351 and vosaroxin), epigenetic modifiers (guadecitabine, IDH inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors), FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT3) inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates (vadastuximab), as well as cell cycle inhibitors (volasertib), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors, and aminopeptidase inhibitors.

372,"A new kind of cloud service, called Database-as-aservice (DaaS), provides a novel paradigm which allows data to be stored in remote databases. The types of database used in remote sites can be divided into two categories: Relational Databases (RDB) and NoSQL. NoSQL databases store data in a flexible format, and without schema, so NoSQL databases can be easily scaled across multiple devices. Because of the advantages of the NoSQL databases, many large data applications use NoSQL databases as the backend data management system. Because NoSQL databases usually access the stored data as files, through a distributed file system, the problem of decentralized data management is critical in NoSQL databases. In order to address this issue, many energy-efficient algorithms for file placement are used in distributed file systems. However, these energy-efficient algorithms only focus on reducing the power consumption of storage systems and they ignore the cost of data reliability, which is affected by frequently setting the disk status to standby mode. To maintain data reliability, energy-efficient storage systems usually combine framework of power conservation and a fault tolerance mechanism. However, most developers of energy-efficient frameworks do not consider whether the fault tolerance mechanism can avoid data loss when this combination is used for energy-efficient storage systems. This study proposes a general energy-efficient framework that can be integrated different fault tolerance mechanisms. The experimental results show that the capability of the proposed framework with different erasure code algorithms.

The cosmetics samples were firstly dispersed by water and subsequently extracted and purified using salting out-acetonitrile homogeneous extraction method. Finally, the extracting solution was concentrated by slow nitrogen gas blowing. All of the samples were separated by INNOWAX capillary chromatographic column, and detected by selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified by isotope internal standard method. The method was validated for linearity and range, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Under the optimized condition, the calibration curves were linear over the selected concentration ranges of 2-500 mu g/L for all the thirteen analytes, with calculated coefficients of determination (R-2) of greater than 0.996. The limits of detection (LODs) and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) of the method were 3-15 mu g/kg and 10-50 mu g/kg, respectively. Recoveries were calculated at three levels of concentration spiked in two kinds of cosmetics (skin care cream and water). The values were found between 93.8% and 121.0% with relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 2.5-7.2% for intra-day precision (n = 6) and 3.3-6.7% for inter-day precision (n = 5).

This creates a flexible process that helps e. g. retrofit projects achieving their goals. The purpose of this paper is to identify key elements that ensure the success of partnering projects for the different stakeholders. This paper will seek to answer the following questions: What elements are used in partnering projects? Is there a link between the use of the different partnering elements and the project's success seen from the client, contractor and user perspective? The research is carried out as a review of partnering literature, as well as an investigation of 10 partnering projects within the Norwegian context, using a case study approach. The investigated projects were both new buildings and retrofittings. A preliminary survey with additional in-depth, semi-structured interviews of clients and contractors was conducted. A document study was also carried out as a supplement to the survey and interviews. Key partnering elements such as early involvement, value-based procurement and start-up workshop were identified through this study. Further analysis revealed that these partnering elements, in combination with soft elements such as trust, commitment and competence, help facilitate success for stakeholders. The identified key partnering elements gives practitioners an implication of which partnering elements should be implemented to achieve project success and more sustainable buildings.

Several affinity tags, such as the hexahistidine tag, maltose-binding protein, streptavidin-binding peptide tag, calmodulin-binding peptide, c-Myc tag, glutathione S-transferase and FLAG tag, have been introduced for recombinant protein production. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the IgG1 antibody is one of the useful affinity tags that can facilitate detection, purification and localization of proteins and can improve the immunogenicity, modulatory effects, physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of proteins. Fc recombinant forms a group of recombinant proteins called Fc-fusion proteins (FFPs).

377,"A range of risk factors lead to opioid use and substance-related problems (SRP) including childhood maltreatment, elevated impulsivity, and psychopathology. These constructs are highly interrelated such that childhood maltreatment is associated with elevated impulsivity and trauma-related psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and impulsivity particularly urgency and PTSD are related. Prior work has examined the association between these constructs and substance-related problems independently and it is unclear how these multi-faceted constructs (i.e., maltreatment types and positive and negative urgency) are associated with one another and SRP. The current study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relations among childhood maltreatment, trait urgency, PTSD symptoms, and SRP in a sample of individuals with a history of opioid use. An initial model that included paths from each type of childhood maltreatment, positive and negative urgency, PTSD and SRP did not fit the data well. A pruned model with excellent fit was identified that suggested emotional abuse, positive urgency, and negative urgency were directly related to PTSD symptoms and only PTSD symptoms were directly related to SRP. Furthermore, significant indirect effects suggested that emotional abuse and negative urgency were related to SRP via PTSD symptom severity. These results suggest that PTSD plays an important role in the severity of SRP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current approach to continuing training of health-care workers uses traditional methods of centralised teaching by formal tutors away from the place of work. This is no longer affordable, achievable or desirable, particularly in rural areas. An innovative system of self-directed learning by groups of nurses caring for mothers and their newborn infants uses specially prepared course books without the need for trainers. Using self-study supported by peer discussion groups, nurses can take responsibility for their own professional growth. This builds competence, confidence and a sense of pride. Since 1993, the Perinatal Education Programme has provided continuing learning opportunities for thousands of nurses in Southern Africa. A number of prospective trials have demonstrated that study groups can significantly improve knowledge and understanding, attitudes, clinical skills and quality of care provided to mothers and infants. A recent review of 10,000 successful participants across a wide range of provinces, ages and home languages documented the success of the project. Using a question-and-answer format to promote problem-solving, case studies, simple skills workshops and multiple choice tests, each module addresses common conditions with appropriate care practices such as thorough drying at birth, delayed cord-clamping, skin-to-skin care, breast feeding, basic resuscitation, correct use of oxygen therapy, hand-washing, blood glucose monitoring and promotion of parental bonding. The training material is now also available free of charge on an on-line website as well as being presented as e-books which can be downloaded onto personal computers, tablet readers and smart phones. This is supplemented by regular SMS text messages providing nurses with relevant 'knowledge bites'.

This study compared the effects of these stress management strategies on personal and relational health. Two hundred and fifty-one dating individuals focused on a stressor that was a current source of rumination. Writing about one's stressor for 5 consecutive days (without talking about it) decreased anxiety the most. Talking continuously about one's stressor to a dating partner harmed the relationship more than writing about or avoiding it. The effect of talking repeatedly about one's stressor on relationship quality and brooding, however, depended upon the emotional support received from one's dating partner and the ability to reappraise (positively or neutrally) the stressor.

With this actuator, the exoskeleton leg can realize several modes of operation, including series elastic actuation, stiff position control and energy storage and release. The energy amplification characteristics of the multimodal actuator in the series elastic mode are analysed. A dynamics model was established to study how series elasticity and the equivalent mass of transmission influence a power source, such as an electric motor. The results, in both simulation and experiment, show that series elasticity can amplify actuator power output, and the power output of a multi modal actuator is greater when the equivalent mass of the transmission mechanism is smaller. This research into multimodal actuator energy amplification supplies important insights into the design of artificial systems that can more closely approximate the performance of biological systems.

The aim of the present study is to explore the associations between P300 and the affective temperamental traits in healthy individuals. We recorded the P300 ERP waves using an auditory oddball paradigm in 50 medical student volunteers (23 females, 27 males). Participants' affective temperaments were evaluated using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-auto questionnaire version (TEMPS-A). In bivariate analyses, depressive temperament score was significantly correlated with P300 latency (r(s) = 0.37, P < .01). In a multiple linear regression analysis, P300 latency showed a significant positive correlation with scores of depressive temperament ( = 0.40, P < .01) and a significant negative one with scores of cyclothymic temperament ( = -0.29, P = .03). Affective temperament scores were not associated with P300 amplitude and reaction times. These results indicate that affective temperaments are related to information processing in the brain.

By simultaneously modelling several thousand flux tubes, a global representation of the plasmasphere can be obtained in a realistic time frame. A global model allows the plasmaspheric contribution to the Total Electron Content (TEC), measured from Global Position System (GPS) satellite radio signals, to be determined and removed, hence permitting the underlying ionosphere to be observed. This paper presents the approach used to model a single magnetic flux tube. GPID assumes an lonosphere/plasmasphere composition of O+ and H+, and includes chemical processes and simple diffusive transport. In almost all situations, GPID reproduces the predictions of the FLIP model. Comparisons between GPID and the refilling fluxes obtained from whistler observations generally show good agreement, both in diurnal variations and during prolonged refilling of empty flux tubes. Comparisons to seasonal variations during solar maximum at L = 2.5 show good agreement with observations, but at solar minimum there is variable agreement. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This method can not only give a comprehensive water quality rank, but also describe the water quality situation with a quantitative value, which is convenient for the water quality comparison between the same ranks. This proposed method is used to assess water quality of Qu River in Sichuan, China. Data used in the assessment were collected from four monitoring stations from 2006 to 2010. The assessment results show that Qu River water quality presents a downward trend and the overall water quality in 2010 is the worst. The spatial variation indicates that water quality of Nanbashequ section is the pessimal. For the sake of comparison, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and grey relational method were also employed to assess water quality of Qu River. The comparisons of these three approaches' assessment results show that the proposed method is reliable. (C) 2016 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

400,"Aluminum/graphite (Al/Gr) composites have been used as self-lubricating materials due to the superior lubricating effect of graphite during sliding. This paper summarizes various tribological aspects of self-lubricating aluminum composites. The influence of various factors such as (a) material factors, graphite size and volume fraction, and (b) mechanical factors, applied load and sliding speed on the tribological properties of self-lubricating aluminum composites, is discussed. Furthermore, the tribological properties of self-lubricating composites as a function of these parameters and the active wear mechanism involved in various systems are discussed. Bringing self-lubricating composites into different operating systems is a solution to reduce the use of external toxic petroleum-based lubricants in sliding contacts in a way to help the environment and reduce energy dissipation in industrial components for strategies toward sustainability and energy efficiency.

402,"Although the introduction of commercial RGB-D sensors has enabled significant progress in the visual navigation methods for mobile robots, the structured-light-based sensors, like Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion Pro Live, have some important limitations with respect to their range, field of view, and depth measurements accuracy. The recent introduction of the second- generation Kinect, which is based on the time-of-flight measurement principle, brought to the robotics and computer vision researchers a sensor that overcomes some of these limitations. However, as the new Kinect is, just like the older one, intended for computer games and human motion capture rather than for navigation, it is unclear how much the navigation methods, such as visual odometry and SLAM, can benefit from the improved parameters. While there are many publicly available RGB-D data sets, only few of them provide ground truth information necessary for evaluating navigation methods, and to the best of our knowledge, none of them contains sequences registered with the new version of Kinect. Therefore, this paper describes a new RGB-D data set, which is a first attempt to systematically evaluate the indoor navigation algorithms on data from two different sensors in the same environment and along the same trajectories. This data set contains synchronized RGB-D frames from both sensors and the appropriate ground truth from an external motion capture system based on distributed cameras. We describe in details the data registration procedure and then evaluate our RGB-D visual odometry algorithm on the obtained sequences, investigating how the specific properties and limitations of both sensors influence the performance of this navigation method.

403,"Animal hairs existing broadly in nature are found to be effectively responsive to stimuli of heat and water in sequence for shape deformation and recovery, namely, coupled shape memory function (CSMF). In the paper, the ability of thermo-water sensitive CSMF was first time investigated for animal hairs, the structural and molecular networks for net-points and switches were therefrom identified. Experimentally, animal hair manifested a high ability of shape fixation in thermal processing and good shape recovery by water stimulus. Characterizations of two stimuli (heating and hydration) were performed systematically on hair's deformation, recovery, viscoelasticity and chemical components (crystalline phase, key bonds inamorphous area). The variations of related chemical components in molecular networks were also explored. A hybrid structural network model was thereafter proposed to interpret the thermo-water sensitive CSMF of hair. This study of two-sequential-stimuli CSMF is original and inspired to explore more complex functions of other smart natural materials and expected to make much smarter synthetic polymers.

404,"A general and systematic formulation based on the finite-element method, modified nodal analysis and multi-field system approach is presented for the analysis of multiple magnetic field systems that are electrically interconnected through circuit networks in the frequency domain. This approach permits simultaneous solution of any number of 2-D Cartesian and axisymmetric problems by considering the electrical terminals of each finite-element model as nonnatural elements of the modified nodal analysis, allowing their systematic incorporation into the global system of equations. This way, arbitrary electrical network topologies can be readily analyzed, where the magnetic systems are no more than simple elements of the circuit system. Moreover, a unified building block is introduced for the 2-D and axisymmetric models, leading to easy computer implementation. The effectiveness of our formulation is tested by determining the electromagnetic behavior of a double-squirrel cage induction motor that is connected to three feeding transformers. A 2-D Cartesian finite-element model is employed for the three-phase motor, whereas an axisymmetric representation is used for each transformer. Hence, four finite-element models are simultaneously solved, which are electrically coupled through circuit elements. Lumped circuit parameters model the end effects of the motor squirrel cage and stator as well as the associated stator feeding circuits. Previous work only considers coupling of Cartesian systems, while our formulation expands the capabilities of quasi-3-D finite-element modeling by systematically coupling 2-D and axisymmetric finite-element models.

406,"A pumped storage unit (PSU) is more difficult to control compared to a conventional hydropower generation unit due to the frequent switching of working conditions and the S-shaped characteristics of pump turbine. The traditional proportional integral derivative (PID) controller typically cannot easily provide high quality control. To overcome these difficulties, a fractional-order PID (FOPID) controller is designed for a PSU in this study. Although the FOPID controller is more effective compared to the traditional PID controller, it is more complex to optimize the parameters of this controller for a pump turbine governing system (PTGS). Thus, a gravitational search algorithm combined with the Cauchy and Gaussian mutation, named as CGGSA, is proposed and used to optimize the FOPID controller parameters. The experimental results indicate that the CGGSA has shown excellent optimization ability compared with some popular meta-heuristics on benchmark functions. Results have also proved that the FOPID-CGGSA controller shows significant advantages over other PID-type controllers with different optimization strategies. Meanwhile the optimally designed controller has shown great potential to improve the control quality of PTGS under multiple water heads. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, evidence is sparse for the effect of increased smoking exposure on disease outcomes or whether smoking reduction or cessation improves outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore whether a dose-response relationship exists between pack-years and disease activity and functional impairment in axSpA. Consecutive patients meeting ASAS criteria for axial SpA were recruited from a spondyloarthritis service. The associations between pack-years of smoking and: (1) disease activity (BASDAI/ASDAS), (2) spinal pain, (3) functional impairment (BASFI) and (4) inflammatory markers were explored using multivariable linear models, adjusted for age, gender and use of TNF inhibition (TNFi) therapy. Pack-years were categorised into four groups (40) and analysed with light smoking (40, beta = 2.6 (0.54, 3.56)), higher BASFI (21-40, beta = 2.1 (0.42, 4.80); >40, beta = 3.2 (0.76, 5.71)), and higher ASDAS (21-40, beta = 0.82 (0.14, 1.51)). This cross-sectional study demonstrated that smoking is associated with increased axSpA severity markers in a dose-response manner. Particular effort should be made to restrict smoking exposure early before accruing a significant number of pack-years.

Regular exercisers were found to have significantly faster response time on the working memory task than non-regular exercisers, and such effect was moderated by actigraphy-measured total sleep time. In other words, regular exercisers had faster reaction time than non-regular exercisers only when they had sufficient sleep (>6.5hours).

The aims of this study were to evaluate these risks in such patients, to determine the risk factors and finally to set some recommendations. Methods It is a cross-sectional study about 180 patients with known and treated adrenal insufficiency. The patients responded to a 14-item questionnaire concerning their knowledge about the disease and fasting during the last month of Ramadan. Results There were 132 women and 48 men. The mean age was 47.6 +/- 15.0 years (14-79). One hundred and thirty eight patients (76.7 %) were advised by their physician not to fast. Ninety-one patients (50.5 %) tried to fast. Complications occurred in 61 cases (67.0 %): asthenia in 88.5% of cases, intense thirst in 32.8 %, symptoms of dehydration in 49.2% and symptoms of hypoglycaemia in 18 %. One patient was hospitalized. Fifty-five patients (60.4 %) were able to fast for the whole month. Age, gender, duration of the disease, its primary origin, associated hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or diabetes insipidus and daily dose of hydrocortisone did not significantly differ between fasters and non-fasters, full-month-fasters and partial-month-fasters, and fasters with complications and fasters without complications. The frequency of adequate knowledge about the disease was significantly higher in full-month-fasters vs. partial-month-fasters, and in fasters without complications vs. those with complications. Conclusion In patients with adrenal insufficiency, fasting can cause complications especially if the level of knowledge about the disease is low.

421,"Ambient Intelligence systems require a natural and personalized experience in interacting with services provided by the environment. In this view, the interaction may happen either in a pervasive way, through a combination of devices embedded in the environment, or using a conversational interface acting as an environment concierge. In the latter case, the interface can be embodied in a conversational agent able to involve users in a human-like conversation and to establish a social relation with them. Developing such an Ambient Conversational System (ACS) requires a model of the user that considers not only the cognitive ingredients of his mental state, but also extra-rational factors such as affect, engagement, attitudes. This paper describes a multimodal framework for recognizing the social attitude of users during the interaction with an embodied agent in a smart environment. In particular, we started from the analysis and annotation of advisory dialogs between humans and then we used the annotated corpus to build a framework for recognizing the social attitude in multimodal dialogs with an ACS. Results of the study show an acceptable performance of the framework in recognizing and monitoring the social attitude during the dialog with anACS. We also compared results of the analysis of human-human interactions with respect to the human-ACS interaction and, even if the level of initiative of subjects during the dialog was lower in this lattermodality, the difference in the average number of social moves was not significant, thus showing that subjects probably were keen to establish a social relation with the conversational agent.

However, the development of (L)-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) limits the long-term use of (L)-DOPA for PD patients. Some data have reported that adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) antagonists prevented LID in animal model of PD. However, the mechanism in which adenosine A(2A)R blockade alleviates the symptoms of LID has not been fully clarified. Here, we determined to knock out (KO) the gene of A(2A)R and explored the possible underlying mechanisms implicated in development of LID in a mouse model of PD. A(2A)R gene KO mice were unilaterally injected into the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in order to damage dopamine neurons on one side of the brain. 6-OHDA-lesioned mice were then injected once daily for 21 days with (L)-DOPA.

427,"Accurate 3D measuring systems thrive in the past few years. Most of them are based on laser scanners because these laser scanners are able to acquire 3D information directly and precisely in real time. However, comparing to the conventional cameras, these kinds of equipment are usually expensive and they are not commonly available to customers. Moreover, laser scanners interfere easily with each other sensors of the same type. On the other hand, computer vision-based 3D measuring techniques use stereo matching to acquire the cameras' relative position and then estimate the 3D location of points on the image. Because this kind of systems needs additional estimation of the 3D information, systems with real time capability often relies on heavy parallelism that prevents implementation on mobile devices. Inspired by the structure from motion systems, we propose a system that reconstructs sparse feature points to a 3D point cloud using a mono video sequence so as to achieve higher computation efficiency. The system keeps tracking all detected feature points and calculates both the amount of these feature points and their moving distances. We only use the key frames to estimate the current position of the camera in order to reduce the computation load and the noise interference on the system. Furthermore, for the sake of avoiding duplicate 3D points, the system reconstructs the 2D point only when the point shifts out of the boundary of a camera. In our experiments, we show that our system is able to be implemented on tablets and can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with a denser point cloud with high speed.

The structure is based on two adaptive neural networks, both with built-in Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials. First substructure network is a regular orthogonal neural network with implemented artificial endocrine factor (OENN), in the form of environmental stimuli, to its weights. It is used for approximation of control signals and for processing system deviation/disturbance signals which are introduced in the form of environmental stimuli. The output values of OENN are used to calculate artificial environmental stimuli (AES), which represent required adaptation measure of a second network orthogonal endocrine adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (OEANFIS). OEANFIS is used to process control, output and error signals of a system and to generate adjustable values of proportional, derivative, and integral parameters, used for online tuning of a PID controller. The developed structure is experimentally tested on a laboratory model of the 3D crane system in terms of analysing tracking performances and deviation signals (error signals) of a payload. OENN-OEANFIS performances are compared with traditional PID and 6 intelligent PID type controllers. Tracking performance comparisons (in transient and steady-state period) showed that the proposed adaptive controller possesses performances within the range of other tested controllers. The main contribution of OENN-OEANFIS structure is significant minimization of deviation signals (17%-79%) compared to other controllers. It is recommended to exploit it when dealing with a highly nonlinear system which operates in the presence of undesirable disturbances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

433,"A multi-channel mixed-signal full-customized CMOS integrated biopotential sensor chip and microcontroller based electronic system have been developed for in vitro extracellular recording of neural signals. The multi-site planar microelectrode array sensors for simultaneous neural signal recording have been designed and prototyped with on-chip fully integrated analog signal processing circuitry and control system. The biosensor system is built with hierarchical modules that incorporate microelectrode electrophysiological sensors, analog signal buffers configured with two-stage amplifier, gain providing amplifiers based on operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with capacitive feedback and digital logic and interface units including clock generation and time division multiplexing control circuitry. The prototype IC was fabricated by MOSIS using AMI C5 0.5 mu m, double poly, triple metal layer CMOS technology. The electroless gold plating process is used to replace the aluminum material obtained from the standard CMOS process with biocompatible metal gold in the planar microelectrode array sensors to prevent cell poisoning and undesirable electrochemical corrosion. The post-CMOS processing and packaging techniques applied to the biosensor chip promotes biocompatibility and stability in the aqueous cell culture environment. A microcontroller based electronic system interfacing the biosensor IC with a client PC for the post processing of the action potential signals sensed by the biopotential sensor chip was also developed. The biosensor has been tested electrically in the presence of electrolyte environment and is shown to provide a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio for neural signals with amplitudes in the range of 600 mu V-2mV and frequencies in the range of 100 Hz - 10 kHz. Biological example in vitro recordings conducted with neurons from Aplysia californica are shown in this research work, which proves the full functionality in neural recording of the biosensor chip incorporated with the interfacing electronic system based on 32-bit Motorola ColdFire MCF5307 RISC processor. On-chip amplification and time division multiplexing techniques of the multi-channel biosensor chip allow the large-scale simultaneous recording of biological activities of neurons.

435,"A cross-sectional reliability study was conducted with 23 normal participants to establish normal values, and the repeatability and validity of distal radioulnar joint translation measurements using ultrasound imaging. Static transverse images of maximal supination, neutral and maximal pronation were examined to assess translation, using a method consistent with the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio. Translation while gripping a 1kg weight in supinated and pronated positions was then compared with non-gripping translation. There was significantly more ulnar radial translation found with pronation than supination, when compared with neutral. Gripping in pronation did not produce statistically significant changes in translation, whereas the changes produced by gripping in supination were significant. Internal consistency was deemed very high and the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio values measured using ultrasound imaging were consistent with previously documented values measured by computerized tomography. This study demonstrated that translational movement of the distal radioulnar joint can be reliably detected in healthy participants using ultrasound imaging. This may reduce dependency on other imaging modalities to diagnose distal radioulnar joint instability. Level of Evidence: 2.

436,"A (beta, epsilon)-hopset for a weighted undirected n-vertex graph G = (V, E) is a set of edges, whose addition to the graph guarantees that every pair of vertices has a path between them that contains at most beta edges, whose length is within 1 + epsilon of the shortest path. In her seminal paper, Cohen [8, JACM 2000] introduced the notion of hopsets in the context of parallel computation of approximate shortest paths, and since then it has found numerous applications in various other settings, such as dynamic graph algorithms, distributed computing, and the streaming model. Cohen [8] devised efficient algorithms for constructing hopsets with polylogarithmic in n number of hops. Her constructions remain the state-of-the-art since the publication of her paper in STOC'94, i.e., for more than two decades. In this paper we exhibit the first construction of sparse hopsets with a constant number of hops. We also find efficient algorithms for hopsets in various computational settings, improving the best known constructions. Generally, our hopsets strictly outperform the hopsets of [8], both in terms of their parameters, and in terms of the resources required to construct them. We demonstrate the applicability of our results for the fundamental problem of computing approximate shortest paths from s sources. Our results improve the running time for this problem in the parallel, distributed and streaming models, for a vast range of s.

437,"A battery-free, wireless neural probe system was developed for reading neural signals in the brain by using a one-port surface acoustic wave (SAW) reflective delay line, neural firing-dependent varicap diode, two antennas, and a network analyzer as measurement unit. The one-port SAW reflective delay line replaces existing complex wireless transceiver system composed of similar to 5000 electronic components and makes battery-free, wireless measurements possible. The varicap diode interconnected with sharp metal shank via operational amplifier (op-amp) was electrically linked to the corresponding split-type reflectors on a one-port SAW reflective delay line. A 4.3 nH inductor was also placed in between the split-type reflector on one-port SAW reflective delay line and varicap diode to obtain a large linearity and high sensitivity through impedance matching effect. As electrical pulses imitating neural signals were applied to the sharp metal shanks, overall impedance perturbations between the split-type reflector and external varicap diode under reverse bias were observed, giving rise to amplitude changes in the reflection peaks in the time domain depending on the magnitude of the electrical pulses. Good linearity and sensitivity were observed at the amplitude variations in terms of electrical pulses. Coupling-of-modes (COM) modeling and impedance matching simulations were also performed to predict device performances and compare experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This limitation can hamper user-driven innovation. In this paper we evaluate the usefulness of the ""app store"" metaphor as a means of sharing and deploying Internet of Things software among makers. We did a set of interviews and a questionnaire-based survey with a sample of makers in various maker communities. We used this data to extract requirements for an application store, using the common ""app store"" metaphor as a starting point. The app store concept was developed as a proof of concept implementation, and evaluated through feasibility evaluation and focus group evaluation methods. Our findings show that although the app store metaphor is familiar and easy to grasp, there are some fundamental challenges when adapting the metaphor: (1) The difficulty of supporting the diversity in the software and hardware vendor market, (2) The tension between context awareness and the need for pre-configuration and pre-packaging, and (3) usability challenges related to the number of devices and apps.

440,"A capacitive charge-division readout method for reading out a 2 x 2 array of 5 mm x 5 mm position-sensitive solid-state photomultipliers (PS-SSPM) was designed and evaluated. Using this analog multiplexing method, the 20 signals (16 position, 4 timing) from the PS-SSPM array are reduced to 5 signals (4 position, 1 timing), allowing the PS-SSPM array to be treated as an individual large-area PS-SSPM module. A global positioning approach can now be used, instead of individual positioning for each PS-SSPM in the array, ensuring that the entire light signal is utilized. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and flood histogram quality at different bias voltages (27.5 V to 32.0 V at 0.5 V intervals) and a fixed temperature of 0 degrees C were evaluated by coupling a 6 x 6 array of 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm x 20 mm polished LSO crystals to the center of the PS-SSPM array. The timing resolution was measured at a fixed bias voltage of 31.0 V and a fixed temperature of 0 degrees C. All the measurements were evaluated and compared using capacitors with different values and tolerances. Capacitor values ranged from 0.051 nf to 10 nf, and the capacitance tolerance ranged from 1% to 20%. The results show that better performance was achieved using capacitors with smaller values and better capacitance tolerance. Using 0.2 nf capacitors, the SNR, energy resolution and timing resolution were 24.3, 18.2% and 8.8 ns at a bias voltage 31.0 V, respectively. The flood histogram quality was also evaluated by using a 10 x 10 array of 1 mm x 1 mm x 10 mm polished LSO crystals and a 10 x 10 array of 0.7 mm x 0.7 mm x 20 mm unpolished LSO crystals to determine the smallest crystal size resolvable. These studies showed that the high spatial resolution of the PS-SSPM was preserved allowing for 0.7 mm crystals to be identified. These results show that the capacitive charge-division analog signal processing method can significantly reduce the number of electronic channels, from 20 to 5, while retaining the excellent performance of the detector.

442,"Acoustophoresis, the ability to acoustically manipulate particles and cells inside a microfluidic channel, is a critical enabling technology for cell-sorting applications. However, one of the major impediments for routine use of acoustophoresis at clinical laboratory has been the reliance on the inherent physical properties of cells for separation. Here, we present a microfluidic-based microBubble-Activated Acoustic Cell Sorting (BAACS) method that rely on the specific binding of target cells to microbubbles conjugated with specific antibodies on their surface for continuous cell separation using ultrasonic standing wave. In acoustophoresis, cells being positive acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure nodes. On the contrary, air-filled polymer-shelled microbubbles being strong negative acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure antinodes and can be used to selectively migrate target cells. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the separation of cancer cell line in a suspension with better than 75% efficiency. Moreover, 100% of the microbubble-cell conjugates migrated to the anti-node. Hence a better upstream affinity-capture has the potential to provide higher sorting efficiency. The BAACS technique expands the acoustic cell manipulation possibilities and offers cell-sorting solutions suited for applications at point of care.

There was no significant heterogeneity in the pooled East Asian and European populations. The fixed effect model analysis again showed no significant association between rs2373115 and AD in these pooled populations.

447,"A common approach to model memristive systems is to include empirical window functions to describe edge effects and nonlinearities in the change of the memristance. We demonstrate that under quite general conditions, each window function can be associated with a sigmoidal curve relating the normalised time-dependent memristance to the time integral of the input. Conversely, this explicit relation allows us to derive window functions suitable for the mesoscopic modelling of memristive systems from a variety of well-known sigmoidals. Such sigmoidal curves are defined in terms of measured variables and can thus be extracted from input and output signals of a device and then transformed to its corresponding window. We also introduce a new generalised window function that allows the flexible modelling of asymmetric edge effects in a simple manner. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The behavior of macrophages depends on their phenotype, and by directing macrophage polarization. unwanted effects may be avoided. In this study, the possibility to modulate the behavior of macrophages activated by biomaterials. was assessed in an in vitro model. Primary human monocytes were seeded on polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polylactic acid yarns, and treated with medications frequently used by patients: rapamycin, dexamethasone, celecoxib or pravastatin. Modulation of the adhering macrophages with rapamycin resulted in a generally pro-inflammatory effect. Dexamethasone caused an overall anti-inflammatory effect on the macrophages cultured on either material, while celecoxib only affected macrophages adhering to polyethylene terephthalate and polylactic acid. Pravastatin increased the. pro-inflammatory genes of macrophages cultured on polypropylene and polylactic acid. Pairwise comparison revealed that macrophages adhering to polylactic acid seemed to be more susceptible to phenotype modulation than when adhering to polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate. The. data show. that macrophages activated by the biomaterials can be modulated, yet the degree of the modulatory capacity depends on the type of material. Combined, this model provides insights into the possibility of using a medication in combination with a biomaterial to direct macrophage behavior and thereby possibly avoid. unwanted effects after implantation.

The ability of the numerical model to consider the load transfer mechanisms and the deflection of the geosynthetic was established by comparison with experimental data. By testing two numerical processes, it was demonstrated that the cavity opening modes have a great influence on the shape of the load distribution transmitted to the geosynthetic sheet above the cavity and on the expansion mechanisms of the soil. An approximate conical load distribution seems well adapted when considering a progressive cavity diameter opening process, whereas an inverted load distribution seems more suitable for a gradual settlement process. In both cases, the intensity of the load transfer mechanism can be approached by the Terzaghi's formulation using an appropriate value for the ratio between the horizontal and vertical stresses.

454,"Although vision-based methods for displacement and vibration monitoring have been used in civil engineering for more than a decade, most of these techniques require physical targets attached to the structures. This requirement makes computer vision-based monitoring for real-life structures cumbersome due to need to access certain critical locations. In this study, a non-target computer vision-based method for displacement and vibration measurement is proposed by exploring a new type of virtual markers instead of physical targets. The key points of measurement positions obtained using a robust computer vision technique named scale-invariant feature transform show a potential ability to take the place of classical targets. To calculate the converting ratio between pixel-based displacement and engineering unit (millimetre), a practical camera calibration method is developed to convert pixel-based displacements to engineering unit since a calibration standard (a target) is not available. Methods and approaches to handle challenges such as low contrast, changing illumination and outliers in matching key points are also presented. The proposed method is verified and demonstrated on the UCF four-span bridge model and on a real-life structure, with excellent results for both static and dynamic behaviour of the two structures. Finally, the method requires a simple, less complicated and more cost-effective hardware compared to conventional displacement and vibration monitoring measuring technologies.

During manufacturing, tiny foreign particles can be present in the ampoule injection. Therefore, strict inspection must be performed before ampoule injections can be sold for hospital use. In the quality control inspection process, most ampoule enterprises still rely on manual inspection which suffers from inherent inconsistency and unreliability. This paper reports an automated system for inspecting foreign particles within ampoule injections. A custom-designed hardware platform is applied for ampoule transportation, particle agitation, and image capturing and analysis. Constructed trajectories of moving objects within liquid are proposed for use to differentiate foreign particles from air bubbles and random noise. To accurately classify foreign particles, multiple features including particle area, mean gray value, geometric invariant moments, and wavelet packet energy spectrum are used in supervised learning to generate feature vectors. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in classifying foreign particles and reducing false positive rates. The automated inspection system inspects over 150 ampoule injections per minute (versus by technologist) with higher accuracy and repeatability. In addition, the automated system is capable of diagnosing impurity types while existing inspection systems are not able to classify detected particles. Note to Practitioners-Present quality assessment of ampoule injections in pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on manual operation by certified technologists or machine-assisted detection systems.

Search rates increased from 2004 until 2010 and thereafter displayed a seasonal pattern peaking in late winter. This knowledge could help guide the timing of public health interventions aimed at managing vitamin D deficiency. Purpose The Internet is an important source of health information. Analysis of Internet search activity rates can provide information on disease epidemiology, health related behaviors and public interest. We explored Internet search rates for vitamin D to determine whether this reflects the increasing scientific interest in this topic. Methods Google Trends is a publically available tool that provides data on Internet searches using Google. Search activity for the term ""vitamin D"" from 1st January 2004 until 31st October 2016 was obtained. Comparison was made to other bone and nutrition related terms. Results Worldwide, searches for ""vitamin D"" increased from 2004 until 2010 and thereafter a statistically significant (p < 0.001) seasonal pattern with a peak in February and nadir in August was observed. This seasonal pattern was evident for searches originating from both the USA (peak in February) and Australia (peak in August); p < 0.001 for both. Searches for the terms ""osteoporosis"", ""rickets"", ""back pain"" or ""folic acid"" did not display the increase observed for vitamin D or evidence of seasonal variation. Conclusion Public interest in vitamin D, as assessed by Internet search activity, did increase from 2004 to 2010, likely reflecting the growing scientific interest, but now displays a seasonal pattern with peak interest during late winter.

This paper attempts to integrate the ecological vulnerability assessment and rehabilitation treatment to assist land managers in revealing vulnerable features along with developing treatments of vulnerability mitigation. Using a post-mining site in a mountainous area in western China as study area, an indicator system and framework for assessing and reducing vulnerability were developed based on a vulnerability analysis. Geo-informatics, such as satellite image processing and spatial analysis, were employed to perform the assessment and planning. It was found that higher exposure and sensitivity are the main causes of increased vulnerability in a seriously disturbed post-mining area. Rehabilitation treatments were arranged spatially and structurally based on the framework of vulnerability mitigation. A pre-evaluation of the effectiveness shows this type of rehabilitation has a convergence effect that clusters and lowers the ecological vulnerability index ( EVI). The average value of EVI will be reduced by 15.02% if the minimum standards of rehabilitation can be completed. Altogether, an integration of rehabilitation treatments and the quantification of vulnerability in a spatially explicit manner are critical for planners to gain more insight into ecological vulnerability in post-mining area, which provides guidance to simplify rehabilitation planning with respect to vulnerability mitigation.

As a corollary, a new method considering the advantages of full-rank decomposition is developed. It is then specialized to the set of polynomial matrices. Therefore, an algorithm for efficient symbolic computation of inverses of a polynomial matrix is proposed. An additional diagonal matrix yields to avoiding the computation of entries containing square roots of polynomials, therefore increasing the algorithm's performances. Some implementation details and comparative processing times to other similar methods are provided, illustrating the algorithm's efficiency.

465,"A rail-to-rail operational amplifier is designed with minimum variation in the input stage transconductance (g(m)) in standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. In this design, transconductance is maintained approximately constant independent of the operation region of the input transistors (i.e., saturation or weak inversion regions). Unlike conventional methods in rail-to-rail designs in which two complementary differential pairs are used, in this work, by using a single input pair, the sensitivity to mismatches between PMOS and NMOS input transistors is eliminated. A Monte-Carlo simulation with n=300 was run to ensure mismatch insensitivity. Simulation results show that the input stage transconductance deviation as the input common-mode voltage varies from rail-to-rail is less than +/- 0.81%, in typical conditions and at 27 degrees C. When the temperature varies from -20 degrees C to 120 degrees C, the variation does not exceed +/- 1.28%. Furthermore, the variations of g(m) two long-channel (L=1 mu m) and short-channel (L=0.18 mu m) cases are +/- 0.85% and +/- 0.9%, respectively. This proves that the introduced circuit works properly regardless of the channel length of the input pair. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

466,"A division-summation (D-Sigma) digital control for three-phase inverters to achieve active and reactive power injection has been presented. It can overcome the limitation of abc to dq frame transformation. However, the D-Sigma control requires four sets of control laws to cover four quadrant operations, namely, grid connection (power factor (PF) 1 similar to +/- 0.866), rectification with PF correction, PF leading (0 similar to 0.866), and PF lagging (0 similar to-0.866). Moreover, the switching sequences for the four modes are also different from each other, increasing complexity of firmware programming. In this paper, improvement of the control law derivation and region selection for the D-Sigma digital control is presented. By selecting the zero-crossing points of phase voltages as region transitions, the control laws and the related parameter tables for the four modes can be unified to a general form. The switching sequences of the four modes are also unified to the switching pattern of the grid-connectionmode. Additionally, a D-Sigma transformation matrix is identified to simplify the derivation procedure of the division (D) and summation (Sigma), which can obtain the control law directly. Measured results from a 10-kVA 3 phi bidirectional inverter have been presented to confirm the improvement.

469,"A prominent software security violation-buffer overflow attack has taken various forms and poses serious threats until today. One such vulnerability is return-oriented programming attack. An return-oriented programming attack circumvents the dynamic execution prevention, which is employed in modern operating systems to prevent execution of data segments, and attempts to execute unintended instructions by overwriting the stack exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability. Numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed in the past few years to mitigate/prevent the attack - compile time methods that add checking logic to the program code before compilation, dynamic methods that monitor the control-flow integrity during execution and randomization methods that aim at randomizing instruction locations. This paper discusses (i) these different static, dynamic, and randomization techniques proposed recently and (ii) compares the techniques based on their effectiveness and performances.

470,"Advancements of recently developed timber products and their application within the prefabrication process require construction management processes to be standardized and unified. These processes then need to be scientifically proven with cross-company references. Apart from technical developments, especially in terms of cost savings and standardization of building procedures, professionalization also plays a fundamental role in providing practical application for a long term success in the market. The current demand for the mass appeal of timber is accompanied by various economical key factors in addition to the question of technical standardized system components, which provide long term stability regarding costs, consistent quality, construction management optimization and sustainability. According to this research paper, the integration of a consistent data workflow during the planning, production, and installation process allows for a significantly shortened construction period with major on site cost reduction as well as for a sustainable approach to delivering a holistic construction management system for timber. The identified criteria and surveyed fundamentals are used to create general construction management methods for the branch. Additionally the applicability was analyzed consistently to determine future potential and generate appropriate and integral timber building systems. Modern timber construction methods are especially suitable for prefabrication because of the material specific properties, its sustainable performance, the possibilities in prefabrication and easier assembly under dry construction conditions. For this reason a high productivity combined with excellent quality in short installation periods provides verifiable arguments for best practice examples in the area of construction management of modern timber building systems.

However, MIBG has a serious disadvantage in that it demands a long examination time. The objective of this study was to evaluate statistically the usefulness of the heart/ mediastinum ratio (H/M) from the early phase of MIBG for the differential diagnosis of DLB. In total, 113 patients were examined, including 32 non-DLB (19 with Alzheimer's dementia) and 79 DLB patients. The mean early-H/M ratio was 2.83 in the non-DLB group and 1.95 in the DLB group. The mean delayed-H/M ratio was 3.0 in the non-DLB group and 1.76 in the DLB group. With a cutoff point of 2.27 on early images, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 65%, 94%, and 73%, respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.82, indicating moderate accuracy. This analysis indicates that images from the early phase of MIBG alone are sufficient for the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and DLB.

Method This is a prospective study including a consecutive series of 38 patients with Crohn's disease of the small bowel who underwent surgery at a specialized colorectal unit of a tertiary hospital. Preoperative magnetic resonance enterography was performed in all patients, following a homogeneous protocol, within the 3 months prior to surgery. A thorough exploration of the small bowel was performed during the surgical procedure; calibration spheres were used according to the discretion of the surgeon. The accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography in detecting areas affected by Crohn's disease in the small bowel was assessed. The findings of magnetic resonance enterography were compared with surgical and pathological findings. Results Thirty-eight patients with 81 lesions were included in the study. During surgery, 12 lesions (14.8%) that were not described on magnetic resonance enterography were found. Seven of these were detected exclusively by the use of calibration spheres, passing unnoticed at surgical exploration. Magnetic resonance enterography had 90% accuracy in detecting the location of the stenosis (75.0% sensitivity, 95.7% specificity). Magnetic resonance enterography did not precisely diagnose the presence of an inflammatory phlegmon (accuracy 46.2%), but it was more accurate in detecting abscesses or fistulas (accuracy 89.9% and 98.6%, respectively). Conclusion Magnetic resonance enterography is a useful tool in the preoperative assessment of patients with Crohn's disease.

473,"Arctic river icings are surface ice accumulations that can be >10km(2) in area and >10m thick. They commonly impact the hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology of Arctic river environments. Previous examination of icing dynamics in Arctic Alaska found no substantial changes in extent through 2005. However, here we use daily time series of satellite imagery for 2000-2015 to demonstrate that the temporal persistence and minimum summertime extent of large icings in part of Arctic Alaska and Canada have declined rapidly. We identified 122 large ephemeral icings, and 70 are disappearing significantly earlier in the summer, with a mean trend of -1.60.9day(-1) for fully ephemeral features. Additionally, 14 of 25 icings that usually persist through the summer have significantly smaller minimum extents (-2.61.6%yr(-1)). These declines are remarkably rapid and suggest that Arctic hydroclimatic systems generating icings, and their associated ecosystems, are changing rapidly. Plain Language Summary Liquid water emerging from groundwater and flowing through Arctic rivers during the winter often freezes into large ice features, which are called river icings. These icings, which are found in nearly all parts of the Arctic, create wide, gravelly river channels that can be important habitat for animals. When icings melt during the summer, they help keep rivers flowing when other water sources are limited. Up until now, no study has systematically looked at whether these features are changing in response to warming temperatures. We use daily satellite imagery available over northern Alaska from 2000 to 2015 in order to test whether icings are becoming smaller or disappearing earlier in the summer. Of 147 features examined, we found that 84 are either becoming smaller (for those that persist throughout the summer) or are disappearing earlier (for those that fully melt each summer). None are becoming larger or disappearing later. These changes may be directly related to warming temperatures, but they may also be happening because climate change is altering how rivers and groundwater interact. If these trends continue, we may see changes in the form of many Arctic rivers and impacts on the habitat of animals like fish and caribou.

474,"A numerical model and experimental validation of Compound Parabolic Concentrators (CPC) for heat generation are presented in this work. A previous model developed has been carefully revised and modified in order to generalize it. The mathematical model consists in a one-dimensional numerical model to describe the thermal and fluid-dynamic behavior of the CPC. Governing equations (continuity, momentum and energy) for the fluid flow inside the CPC absorber tube, together with the energy equation for the absorber tube wall, cover, insulation and reflector, and the thermal analysis of the solar concentrator are solved iteratively in an individually manner as the most suitable and reliable numerical strategy for numerical convergence. A prototype of CPC was used to evaluate and validate the numerical model. This consisted of a cylindrical absorber with a real concentration ratio of 1.8, acceptance angle of 30, and aperture area of 0.1764 m(2). A measurement uncertainty analysis was carried out.

The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the medium-term efficacy of SNS for IBS to establish whether SNS could have a future role in the treatment of IBS. Method Patients with IBS who had previously been implanted with a permanent neurostimulator as part of a randomized, controlled, crossover study, were assessed for medium-term follow-up. The primary end-point was change in the IBS-specific symptom score (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Irritable Bowel Syndrome version questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. The secondary end-point was a change in the IBS-specific quality of life score (Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Impact Scale questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. Results Of 26 patients, 20 were eligible for 3-year follow- up. The median IBS-specific symptom score was significantly lower at 3-year follow-up (30, range 1371) than at baseline (62, 45-80) (P = 0.0001). The effect was observed in all symptom clusters within the score. Also, the median IBS-specific quality of life score was significantly improved at 3-year follow-up (52, 26-169) compared with baseline (135, 82-180, P = 0.0002). The effect was observed in all domains of the score. As per the protocol, 75% of patients were judged therapeutic successes.

477,"A new approach to the control of electro-magneto-mechanical system is proposed in this paper. Conventionally, these systems are controlled based on the Maxwell system model via an on-off or PID control technique, which displays acceptable performance in the low frequency region, but not in the high frequency region where position control performance is greatly degraded. In order to improve the performance, a newly developed virtual 2(nd) order system modeling technique, SSID, is adopted for a complex electro-magnetomechanical system in the study. This technique states that any unknown system exposed to a random disturbance with unknown intensity can be identified in terms of a virtual 2(nd) order system model via the inverse process of a certain stochastic analysis. As a typical hybrid system, a solenoid valve is used as the target electro-magneto-mechanical system to study the modeling of the virtual 2(nd) order system. In order to confirm the performance of the proposed control strategy, autotuning PID controller in PWM mode is utilized. Simulations based on the conventional Maxwell system model with control via the bang-bang, autotuning PID, and the proposed virtual 2(nd) order system model approaches are conducted using MATLAB Simulink. Performance of these three systems in the low and high frequency bands is also compared. The simulation results reveal that the control performance of the virtual 2(nd) order system model is much improved compared with that of the Maxwell system model under autotuning PID and bang-bang controls in both low and high frequency regions, where the error is drastically reduced to approximately 1/5 of the original value.

It can substantially change the biological identity of nanomaterials and possibly trigger adverse responses from the body tissues. Dissecting the role of the corona in the development of a particular disease may provide profound insights for understanding toxicity of nanomaterials in general. In our present study, we explored the capability of different silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to induce silicosis in the mouse lung and analyzed the composition of coronas formed on these particles. We found that SiNPs of certain size and surface chemistry could specifically recruit transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)intotheircorona, which subsequently induces the development of lung fibrosis. Once embedded into the corona on SiNPs, TGF-beta l was remarkably more stable than in its free form, and its fibrosis-triggering activity was significantly prolonged. Our study meaningfully demonstrates that a specific corona component on a certain nanoparticle could initiate a particular pathogenic process in a clinically relevant disease model. Our findings may shed light on the understanding of molecular mechanisms of human health risks correlated with exposure to small-scale substances.

483,"A globally convergent and fully coupled 3D inverse model for smart materials is presented. In practice, stress and field (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are applied to smart materials whereas strain and flux density (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are measured. We refer to constitutive models that follow this scheme as direct models. In certain design and control situations, however, inverse models are necessary in which the field and stress are found from specified flux density and strain. This inversion typically involves an iterative procedure, which may be prone to convergence issues. An inverse model approach is proposed for arbitrary smart materials. The inversion requirement is a continuous and second order differentiable direct model for any chosen smart material. The approach is globally convergent, which makes it ideal for use in finite element frameworks. The premise of the proposed iterative system model is to constitute a recursive correction formula based on second order approximations of a novel scalar error function which offers a faster convergence rate. A continuation approach is then used to achieve global convergence for arbitrary input parameters. Magnetostrictive Galfenol is chosen to illustrate the effectiveness of the inverse model, and compact analytical derivations of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices are presented. The convergence rate of the proposed approach is superior to that of an existing inverse model. Finally, the inverse model's robustness is demonstrated through integration of the model into a finite-element framework to simulate a magnetostrictive composite plate actuator in full 3D.

The I-V characteristic of PVG is characterized using five solar radiation dependent parameters, two of which are short circuit current and open circuit voltage of PVGs. A DC/DC converter is used as a matching circuit between the load and PVG. Selecting a suitable fixed frequency, the duty cycle (delta) of DC/DC converter has been determined adaptively by microcontroller, by getting feedback from the instantaneous value of the output voltage. As such the system is suitable for dynamic and static loads. Therefore the system needs two measurements, which are solar radiation intensity and feedback from the output voltage across the load, which are fed to microcontroller. The measured solar radiation intensity is converted by microcontroller into percent solar radiation, G, where the highest ever value of the solar radiation intensity in the location is fed to the microcontroller as the base value. The system parameters are PVC dependent and need to be obtained separately for every PVC. A prototype has been built and reasonable correlation is obtained between the measured and simulated results.

496,"A simple, fast, sensitive and accurate methodology based on a LLE followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for simultaneous determination of four regioisomers (8-iso prostaglandin F-2 alpha, 8-iso-15(R)-prostaglandin F-2 alpha, 11 beta-prostaglandin F-2 alpha, 15(R)-prostaglandin F-2 alpha) in routine analysis of human plasma samples was developed. Isoprostanes are stable products of arachidonic acid peroxidation and are regarded as the most reliable markers of oxidative stress in vivo. Validation of method was performed by evaluation of the key analytical parameters such as: matrix effect, analytical curve, trueness, precision, limits of detection and limits of quantification. As a homoscedasticity was not met for analytical data, weighted linear regression was applied in order to improve the accuracy at the lower end points of calibration curve. The detection limits (LODs) ranged from 1.0 to 2.1 pg/mL. For plasma samples spiked with the isoprostanes at the level of 50 pg/mL, intra-and interday repeatability ranged from 2.1 to 3.5% and 0.1 to 5.1%, respectively. The applicability of the proposed approach has been verified by monitoring of isoprostane isomers level in plasma samples collected from young patients (n = 8) subjected to hyperbaric hyperoxia (100% oxygen at 280 kPa(a) for 30 min) in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber.

499,"A novel monobloc design of a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) compliant tool tip for a handheld powered surgical tool is presented in this paper. The monobloc tool tip can pitch and yaw using corner-filleted flexure hinge-based compliant joints and has an integrated compliant grasper. The 2DOF of the tool tip is realized by six compliant joints placed in an alternating fashion, orthogonal to each other. The tool is externally powered and consists of a drive box, a stainless steel tube, and a compliant tool tip at the distal end. The drive box houses a thumb joystick for command input, three servo actuators, and a microcontroller. The microcontroller maps surgeon's command input to the tool tip orientation and grasper actuation. By design, the graspers of the tool tip are actuated by tensile forces conveyed by the tethers, which exert a compressive load on the 2DOF compliant joints. Since the compressive load-carrying capacity of slender flexure-based compliant joints is limited, a design to enhance the compressive loadcarrying capacity of the compliant joints with a circular guide is presented. A finite-element simulation was done to verify the design of the compliant joints. Experiments were carried out to assess the relationship between the force input by the servo actuators and joint deflection. Additional experiments were carried out to determine the maximum pinching force that can be exerted by the compliant graspers. A prototype of the complete surgical tool was built to demonstrate the utility of the proposed compliant tool tip as an alternative to traditional tool tip for a handheld powered surgical tool.

500,"Adaptive algorithms are prevalently applied in the design of nonlinear active noise control (ANC) systems. The most important nonlinearity in ANC is the saturation effect produced by the electro-acoustical sensors and transducers. The dominant saturation nonlinearity is in the transducers, which can be represented by a Wiener model. An effective solution to mitigate such nonlinear distortion is to employ the Nonlinear Filtered-X Least Mean Square (NLFXLMS) algorithm. The controller compensates the nonlinearity using a model of the saturation effect represented by the scaled error function (SEF). However, the NLFXLMS is limited by two practical issues such that the degree of nonlinearity has to be known in advance and the SEF cannot be evaluated in real time. In this work, the NLFXLMS algorithm is modified by incorporating the tangential hyperbolic function (THF) to model the saturation effect of the loudspeaker. The proposed THF-NLFXLMS algorithm, models the nonlinear secondary path and applies the estimated degree of nonlinearity in the control algorithm design. The results show that the Wiener secondary path, with saturation nonlinearity represented by SEF, can be modelled by THF with a certain degree of accuracy and can yield a reasonable estimate of the degree of nonlinearity. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable with the benchmark NLFXLMS and is superior to the conventional FXLMS as well as the second order Volterra algorithm of similar computational complexity with the proposed algorithm.

503,"A root-zone water balance model was used to simulate the soil moisture storage of maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields in rainfed uplands of eastern India. The simulation study revealed that short duration (95 days) rice fields in uplands remained under ponding condition for a period of 32 days during the entire growing season. Based on the ponding depth requirement in rice fields (50 mm), excess ponding was found for seven days only out of the 32 days of ponding. In contrast, the maize field under similar length of growing season (95 days) and topographic condition could produce harvestable runoff for 23 days. Furthermore, the rice crop was to remain under moisture stress for eight days during its mid-season stage, whereas the maize was found to be without stress during entire growing season. Before sowing of winter crops, the soil moisture in the seeding zone was determined to be depleted below germination soil moisture for 18 and 19 years out of 30 years of simulation in rice and maize fields, respectively. This implies that a second crop, following withdrawal of monsoon, is not possible without pre-sowing irrigation in three out of five years in rainfed uplands. Thus, complete substitution of rice by maize in uplands would create a better scope for rainwater harvesting. Alternatively, partial replacement of rice could be a viable option for meeting both rice demand of the people and harvesting of adequate rainwater for supplemental irrigation to crops in rainy and winter seasons.

504,"A long-term Northern Hemisphere (NH) daily 5-km snow cover extent (SCE) product (JASMES) was developed by the application of a consistent objective snow cover mapping algorithm to data from historical optical sensors on polar orbiting satellites from 1978 to 2015. A conventional decision tree algorithm with multiple threshold tests was employed to analyze radiances for the five spectral bands available across the full analysis period. The accuracies of the analyzed SCE maps were evaluated against in-situ snow data measured at ground stations along with the SCE maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) product. The evaluation showed the JASMES product to have a more temporally stable producer's accuracy (PA; 1-omission error) than NOAA, which is a key factor in the analysis of long-term SCE trends. Comparison of seasonal NH SCE trends from the two products showed NOAA to have opposite trends to those of JASMES in the fall and winter seasons, and to have overestimated SCE decreasing trends in the spring and summer. These tendencies are consistent with the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of information over time, which were used in generating the NOAA snow analysis. An estimation of unbiased SCEs based on the accuracies of SCE maps also endorses the long-term trends of the JASMES product The JASMES NH seasonal SCE exhibited negative slopes in all seasons but was only statistically significant in the summer (JJA) and fall (SON). Delayed snow cover onset was observed to be the main driver of decreasing annual snow duration (SCD) trends. The spatial pattern of annual SCD trends exhibited noticeable asymmetry between continents, with the largest significant decreases observed over western Eurasia with relatively few statistically significant decreases over North America.

505,"A pineal cyst is a benign affection of the human pineal gland on the borderline between pathology and normality. Only a small percentage of patients present with symptoms and a surgical treatment is indicated in highly selected cases. A melatonin secretion in patients with a pineal cyst before and after a pineal cyst resection has not been studied yet and the effect of surgery on human metabolism is unknown. The present study examined melatonin, cortisol and blood glucose secretion profiles peri-operatively in a surgical group of 4 patients. The control group was represented by 3 asymptomatic patients with a pineal cyst. For each patient, 24-h circadian secretion curves of melatonin, cortisol and glycemia were acquired. An analysis of melatonin profiles showed an expected diurnal pattern with the night peak in patients before the surgery and in the control group. In contrast, melatonin levels in patients after the surgery were at their minimum throughout the whole 24-h period. The cortisol secretion was substantially increased in patients after the surgery. Blood glucose sampling showed no statistically significant differences. Clinical results demonstrated statistically significant headache relief measured by Visual Analogue Scale in patients after the surgery. Despite the small number of examined patients, we can conclude that patients with a pineal cyst preserved the physiological secretion of the hormone melatonin while patients who underwent the pineal cyst resection experienced a loss of endogenous pineal melatonin production, which equated with pinealectomy. Surprisingly, cortisol secretion substantially increased in patients after the surgery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

506,"Along with the rapid advancement of digital image processing technology, image denoising remains a fundamental task, which aims to recover the original image from its noisy observation. With the explosive growth of images on the Internet, one recent trend is to seek high quality similar patches at cloud image databases and harness rich redundancy therein for promising denoising performance. Despite the well-understood benefits, such a cloud-based denoising paradigm would undesirably raise security and privacy issues, especially for privacy-sensitive image data sets. In this paper, we initiate the first endeavor toward privacy-preserving image denoising from external cloud databases. Our design enables the cloud hosting encrypted databases to provide secure query-based image denoising services. Considering that image denoising intrinsically demands high quality similar image patches, our design builds upon recent advancements on secure similarity search, Yao's garbled circuits, and image denoising operations, where each is used at a different phase of the design for the best performance. We formally analyze the security strengths. Extensive experiments over real-world data sets demonstrate that our design achieves the denoising quality close to the optimal performance in plaintext.

Stress and exposure to violence (e.g., intimate partner violence (IPV), nonpartner violence) are predictors of poor quality of life for adult women; however, these associations remain understudied among adolescent and young mothers in urban areas. Guided by the social ecological model, the current study created a latent variable, urban social stress, to examine the impact of the urban social environment (i.e., stressful life events, discrimination, family stress, and neighborhood problems) on the quality of life of adolescent and young mothers during both pregnancy and postpartum. The current study is a secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study of 296 expectant young mothers recruited at obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Results from structural equation and multigroup models found that higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life during pregnancy, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-exposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. In the postpartum period, higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-unexposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. Stress reduction programs need to help adolescent and young mothers in urban areas develop stress management skills specific to urban social stress. Pregnancy and parenting programs need to be tailored to the specific needs of young mothers in urban areas by becoming sensitive to the role of IPV and nonpartner violence in these young women's lives.

510,"All-to-all comparison problems represent a class of big data processing problems widely found in many application domains. To achieve high performance for distributed computing of such problems, storage usage, data locality and load balancing should be considered during the data distribution phase in the distributed environment. Existing data distribution strategies, such as the Hadoop one, are designed for problems with MapReduce pattern and do not consider comparison tasks at all. As a result, a huge amount of data must be re-arranged at runtime when the comparison tasks are executed, degrading the overall computing performance significantly. Addressing this problem, a scalable and efficient data distribution strategy is presented in this paper with comparison tasks in mind for distributed computing of all-to-all comparison problems. Specifically designed for problems with all-to-all comparison pattern, it not only saves storage space and data distribution time but also achieves load balancing and good data locality for all comparison tasks of the all-to-all comparison problems.

513,"An important number of academic tasks should be solved collaboratively by groups of learners. The Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems support this collaboration by means of shared workspaces and tools that enable communication and coordination between learners. Successful collaboration and interaction can depend on the criteria followed when forming the groups of learners. This paper proposes a method that analyses the collaboration and interaction between learners using a set of indicators or variables about how they solve academic tasks. Then, the concept of data depth is used as a measurement of the closeness of the analysis indicators' values for a learner with respect to the values that the same indicators take for the other learners. Finally, the data depth is used to form new groups of learners whose analysis indicators take similar or different values. Thus, the method enables teachers to form homogeneous and heterogeneous groups according to their preferences. This group formation process is carried out automatically by a software tool. This paper presents two case studies in which the method is applied to form groups of learners who solve academic tasks in different domains (computer programming and data mining).

514,"A rarely explored subject in animal research is the effect of pre-injury variables on behavioral outcome post-SCI. Low reporting of such variables may underlie some discrepancies in findings between laboratories. Particularly, intensive task-specific training before a SCI might be important, considering that sports injuries are one of the leading causes of SCI. Thus, individuals with SCI often underwent rigorous training before their injuries. In the present study, we asked whether training before SCI on a grasping task or a swimming task would influence motor recovery in rats. Swim pre-training impaired recovery of swimming 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. This result fits with the idea of motor learning interference, which posits that learning something new may disrupt learning of a new task; in this case, learning strategies to compensate for functional loss after SCI. In contrast to swimming, grasp pre-training did not influence grasping ability after SCI at any time point. However, grasp pre-trained rats attempted to grasp more times than untrained rats in the first 4 weeks post-injury. Also, lesion volume of grasp pre-trained rats was greater than that of untrained rats, a finding which may be related to stress or activity. The increased participation in rehabilitative training of the pre-trained rats in the early weeks post-injury may have potentiated spontaneous plasticity in the spinal cord and counteracted the deleterious effect of interference and bigger lesions. Thus, our findings suggest that pre-training plays a significant role in recovery after CNS damage and needs to be carefully controlled for. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The wind loading on the bridge deck was evaluated by means of flutter derivatives (FDs), which are measured in a wind tunnel test on a section-model of the deck. These aeroelastic coefficients are random due to experimental errors. A statistical approach was employed to evaluate the effects of this uncertainty source on the wind-induced response and the damage produced on the structure. In the first part of the study ""fragility curves and surfaces"" were used to estimate the exceedance probability of representative structural performance threshold indicators by accounting for experimental errors in the estimation of FDs. These thresholds were based on deck acceleration (for user comfort) and peak deck displacements (for structural damage).

In this study, we found that pomegranate extract (PG-E) significantly reduced P. acnes-induced edema inWistar rat ears. Therefore, an evaluation platform using multiple pathogenic mechanisms of acne was established to explore the anti-acne effects of pomegranate. Results showed that PG-E inhibited bacterial growth and lipase activity. Through a bioguided-fractionation-isolation system, four hydrolysable tannins, punicalagin (1), punicalin (2), strictinin A (3), and granatin B (4), were isolated. Compounds 1 and 2 had greater anti-bacterial activities and anti-testosterone-induced HaCaT proliferative effects than the others. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 displayed lipase inhibitory effects. Compound 4 decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression and downregulated prostaglandin E-2 production in heat-killed P. acnes-treated RAW 246.7 cells. In conclusion, PG-E is abundant in hydrolysable tannins that display multiple anti-acne capacities, including anti-bacterial, anti-lipase, anti-keratinocyte proliferation, and anti-inflammatory actions.

Though initial therapy with ustekinumab achieved a sustained response in our patient, after a seven months of interruption, retreatment resulted in a slower and poorer response than the initial regimen. Both responses of our patient reflects: (i) the recalcitrant chronic nature of ACH in some patients, (ii) the value of ustekinumab in ACH treatment, (iii) the fact that, as with other biologics, a loss of response may also occur with ustekinumab when the treatment is interrupted. All these data provides evidence for the fact that the course of ACH is unpredictable and possibly indicate that concerning current biologics used in the treatment of ACH, we have still failed to hit the target we aimed for.

527,"A notion of a universal construction suited to distributed computing has been introduced by Herlihy in his celebrated paper ""Wait-free synchronization"" (ACM Trans Program Lang Syst 13(1):124-149, 1991). A universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to wait-free implement any object defined by a sequential specification. Herlihy's paper shows that the basic system model, which supports only atomic read/write registers, has to be enriched with consensus objects to allow the design of universal constructions. The generalized notion of a k -universal construction has been recently introduced by Gafni and Guerraoui (Proceedings of 22nd international conference on concurrency theory (CONCUR'11), Springer LNCS 6901, pp 17-27, 2011). A k-universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to simultaneously implement k objects (instead of just one object), with the guarantee that at least one of the k constructed objects progresses forever. While Herlihy's universal construction relies on atomic registers and consensus objects, a k-universal construction relies on atomic registers and k-simultaneous consensus objects (which are wait-free equivalent to k-set agreement objects in the read/write system model). This paper significantly extends the universality results introduced by Herlihy and Gafni-Guerraoui. In particular, we present a k-universal construction which satisfies the following five desired properties, which are not satisfied by the previous k-universal construction: (1) among the k objects that are constructed, at least objects (and not just one) are guaranteed to progress forever; (2) the progress condition for processes is wait-freedom, which means that each correct process executes an infinite number of operations on each object that progresses forever; (3) if any of the k constructed objects stops progressing, all its copies (one at each process) stop in the same state; (4) the proposed construction is contention-aware, in the sense that it uses only read/write registers in the absence of contention; and (5) it is generous with respect to the obstruction-freedom progress condition, which means that each process is able to complete any one of its pending operations on the k objects if all the other processes hold still long enough. The proposed construction, which is based on new design principles, is called a -universal construction. It uses a natural extension of k-simultaneous consensus objects, called -simultaneous consensus objects (-SC). Together with atomic registers, -SC objects are shown to be necessary and sufficient for building a -universal construction, and, in that sense, -SC objects are -.

528,"A complete structural health monitoring system has been implemented on Aizhai Suspension Bridge for monitoring its health status and assessing its safety for long-term services. This system consists of nearly 112 sensors of various types, including four subsystems: automatic data collection subsystem, artificial maintenance management subsystem, early safety warning and comprehensive assessment subsystem, and centralized database management subsystem. The deployments and functions of this structural health monitoring system are first introduced in this paper. Then, a finite-element model updating method, which combines the substructure method with the response surface model updating method, is proposed to reconstruct the actual working state of this suspension bridge in the early safety warning and comprehensive assessment subsystem. In the remaining part, the temperature fields, strain responses, tension forces of the hangers, longitudinal displacements of the stiffening girder, and the meteorological temperature are analyzed. Through the statistical analysis, the relationship between the temperature fields was found; the temperature fields induced strains of the stiffening girder satisfies the linear relationship. The cumulative probability distribution function of the cycle-index of the same daily stress amplitude follows a Weibull distribution. The monitored relative longitudinal displacements of the stiffening girder are linearly related with the meteorological temperatures. The monitored tension forces of the hangers verify the effects of the suspender-free zones of main cables on the normal hangers for this pylongirder detached suspension bridge.

The effect of the input-referred offset on the quiescent power of audio power amplifier (APA) that drives very small resistive load is described and analyzed. A digitally assisted offset calibration-based APA topology together with improved frequency compensation is proposed. This permits the use of low quiescent power and small compensation capacitance. Implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology, the amplifier occupies an area of 0.15 mm(2) and consumes 0.4 mW at +/- 1 V supplies. At the load of 16 Omega//200 pF, the gain-bandwidth product is 1.78 MHz using a total compensation capacitance of 8.5 pF. Other performance metrics are measured with -89-dB total harmonic distortion (THD+ N), 93.5-dB signal-to-noise ratio, 84-dB power supply rejection ratio (PSRR+), and 105-dB PSRR-@ 217 Hz. It can deliver a peak power of 35 mW (1.5 Vpp swing) to the above load, yielding the best figure-of-merit (FOM) = (peak load power/quiescent power) and the best FOM2 = [peak load power/quiescent power * (THD+ N)%] with respect to other reported representative works.

In addition, the prosthesis response to pressure and temperature was observed. Pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties of this ear prosthesis were investigated using an astable multivibrator circuit, as changes in PVDF permittivity were observed according to variations of pressure and temperature. The results show that this prosthesis is reliable for use under different conditions of pressure (0 Pa to 16,350 Pa) and temperature (2 degrees C to 90 degrees C). The experimental results show an almost linear and inversely proportional behavior between the stimuli of pressure and temperature with the frequency response. This 3D-printed ear prosthesis is a promising tool and has a great potentiality in the biomedical engineering field because of its ability to generate an electrical potential proportional to pressure and temperature, and it is the first time that such a device has been processed by the additive manufacturing process (3D printing). More work needs to be carried out to improve the performance, such as electrical stimulation of the nervous system, thereby extending the purpose of a prosthesis to the area of sensory perception.

531,"After menopause, estradiol is primarily synthesized in peripheral tissues by the enzyme aromatase, encoded by CYP19A1. CYP19A1 variation associates with circulating estradiol in postmenopausal women and this variation is best represented by the intronic variant rs727479. This variation appears to have pleiotropic effects as it also associates with endometrial cancer risk. Indeed, estradiol plays an important role in the development of breast and endometrial cancer. Aromatase inhibitor (AI) drugs are used in the treatment of both diseases, however, response rates for AIs are low and there is currently no way to identify breast or endometrial cancer patients who are more likely to receive a clinical benefit. Multiple studies have proposed that genetic variation in CYP19A1 will have effects on AI efficacy: eight candidate variant studies of sample size greater than 50 describe associations between CYP19A1 variation and the outcome of patients treated with AIs. Nominally significant associations with patient outcome were reported for several variants, including rs727479. However, only an association between rs4646 and time to progression was replicated in an independent study. Moreover, rs4646 is also the only variant that has an association with patient outcome that passes a multiple testing threshold and this variant is in linkage disequilibrium with rs727479, supporting the hypothesis that associations with patient outcome may be driven through the effects on circulating estradiol. Despite this preliminary evidence, well phenotyped and comprehensively genotyped patient sets need to be studied before conclusions can be drawn about the effects of CYP19A1 variation on AI efficacy.

In this study, we explored the effects of miR-15a-5p overexpression on apoptosis and invasion in lung cancer cells. The mRNA level of miR-15a-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines was determined by real-time PCR. The miR-15a-5p mimic was transiently transfected into lung cancer cells using Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 reagent. Subsequently, the Brdu-ELISA results showed that introduction of miR-15a-5p inhibited cell proliferation. In addition, miR-15a-5p overexpression could also inhibit EMT of A549 and H460 cells. qRT-PCR were used to determined the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and -9) in lung cancer cells. Next, we found that NF-kappa B1 expression was evidently reduced by up-regulation of miR-15a-5p. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the NF-kappa B1 was a potential target gene of miR-15a-5p. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-15a-5p could directly target the 3' UTR of NF-kappa B1. In conclusion, miR15a-5p suppresses proliferation and metastasis in lung cancer cells by down-regulation of NF-kappa B1 and overexpression of miR-15a-5p might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer in the future.

534,"Acute bioprosthetic valve thrombosis can occur after surgery and sometimes cause hemodynamic instability and cardiogenic shock. Risk factors for bioprosthetic valve thrombosis are hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, atrial dilatation, low cardiac function, and lack of anticoagulation therapy. The authors present a case of severe mitral stenosis due to bioprosthetic valve thrombus. The patient was diagnosed with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and underwent mitral valve replacement. He required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) due to extremely low cardiac output and was scheduled for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Transesophageal echocardiographic examination before LVAD implantation revealed severe mitral stenosis due to bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombus, which was not detected by transthoracic echocardiography in the intensive care unit and contributed to the low cardiac function. The thrombus was removed through an unscheduled left atriotomy before LVAD implantation. The possibility of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis must be considered when the patient is dependent on VA-ECMO support. Early transesophageal echocardiographic examination of the bioprosthetic valve may be helpful and contribute to surgical decision-making.

536,"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) based stand level forest inventory has been used in Finland and other Nordic countries for several years. In the Russian Federation, ALS is not extensively used for forest inventory purposes, despite a long history of research into the use of lasers for forest measurement that dates back to the 1970s. Furthermore, there is also no generally accepted ALS-based methodology that meets the official inventory requirements of the Russian Federation. In this paper, a method developed for Finnish forest conditions is applied to ALS-based forest inventory in the Perm region of Russia. Sparse Bayesian regression is used with ALS data, SPOT satellite images and field reference data to estimate five forest parameters for three species groups (pine, spruce, deciduous): total mean volume, basal area, mean tree diameter, mean tree height, and number of stems per hectare. Parameter estimates are validated at both the plot level and stand level, and the validation results are compared to results published for three Finnish test areas. Overall, relative root mean square errors (RMSE) were higher for forest parameters in the Perm region than for the Finnish sites at both the plot and stand level. At the stand level, relative RMSE generally decreased with increasing stand size and was lower when considered overall than for individual species groups.

537,"According to self-determination theory, an individual's goal content and the processes involved in goal setting often represent the status of the individual's mental health and well-being. When examining the importance placed on goal setting, an individual's goals and aspirations are often synonymous with mental health and well-being. Aspiring to achieve intrinsic life goals has been associated with greater psychological well-being in literature. This study therefore aimed to establish the relationships between goals and aspirations, mental health behaviour (interpersonal relations, stress management, and spiritual growth), and psychological well-being (measured by positive affect). A sample of 457 secondary school learners in the Overberg Educational District, Western Cape, South Africa, participated in the study. The results suggest a significant positive relationship between placing importance on intrinsic goals and aspirations, and psychological well-being (as indicated by positive affect). However, psychological well-being was not correlated with mental health behaviour. The results of the hierarchical regression analysis suggest that importance placed on intrinsic goals and aspirations predicts psychological well-being and accounts for 8% of the variance. The results highlight the role of intrinsic goals and aspirations in predicting the psychological well-being of adolescents. The findings are supported by the theoretical assumptions of self-determination theory.

The embankment construction was performed in four stages over 65days, resulting in a total applied stress of around 150kPa. The soft soil and the encased columns were instrumented to measure surface settlements, excess pore pressure, surface vertical stresses, and radial deformation of the geotextile encasement. Stress concentration and the difference in settlement between the top of the encased columns and the soft soil were studied. Results showed that the differential settlement increased as the embankment height increased and when the excess pore pressure was being dissipated. Due to soil arching, the vertical stress supported by the encased column was over two times greater than the stress transmitted to the soft soil. Also, vertical stress on the encased column increased as consolidation progressed, whereas it did not vary significantly on the soft soil. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

539,"A methodology has been developed for selection of gear number and transmission gear ratios in mechanical part of a wheel-type tractor with electro-mechanical transmission containing a propulsion asynchronous electric motor with variable-frequency control. The paper proposes to determine a transmission gear ratio on the basis of the following: provision of wheel torque dependence on tractor speed which is the best one for a traction process and during transfer from one gear to the other; provision of nominal operational mode of the electric motor for all tractor operations where it is working for a long period of time; provision of minimum possible number of gears; complete realization of internal combustion engine power on the tractor wheels at limit operational mode of the electric motor. As a characteristic of the asynchronous electric motor with variable-frequency control contains various portions which can be used either completely or partially due to operating conditions, the gear number is determined in the process of transmission gear ration finding but not prior to this. A wheel torque of the tractor with electro-mechanical transmission can be limited according to the following factors: grip of wheel with supporting surface; maximum power of an internal combustion engine which can be transferred to the wheels and a torque which is developed by a propulsion electric motor. It is not proposed to exceed nominal operational mode of the propulsion electric motor for all the operations of the tractor if it is working for a long period of time because in the case of significant excess of the nominal operational mode of the asynchronous electric motor its rather long operation leads to low efficiency and high losses in power, large heat liberation and consequently requires to develop more complicated system for electric motor cooling. An excess of nominal electric motor torque can be justified for short-term operational modes because in this case there is no need to select more powerful electric motor and create an additional gear in the gear-box.

Precipitates of nano dimensions formed in situ have been used to form coherent, usually amorphous, films of metal oxides, sulfides, etc. on solid surfaces including textiles. This phenomena has been successfully used to polymerize pyrrole on the surface of textile fibers, fabrics, or yarns. While pyrrole is particularly suitable for this process, other monomers such as aniline or thiophene may be used, Polypyrrole is one of the more environmentally stable conductive materials and the above process has been successfully used in industrial production. The electrical properties and the environmental stability of the product depend on a number of variables such as concentration of the chemicals and particularly the dopants used. Furthermore, the environmental stability of the conductive textiles can be significantly improved by the use of certain additives in the polymerization. Numerous applications have been found for conductive textiles, especially in the field where their microwave adsorption characteristics are highly desirable. This is the case in military applications like camouflage and stealth technology.

541,"A nonlinear analysis framework for bluff-body aerodynamics based on Volterra theory is introduced to capture the linear and nonlinear aerodynamic effects. The Volterra kernels based on the impulse function concept are identified by way of the simulation of Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The computational schemes used here are validated through theoretical consideration, i.e., Blasius solution for the steady-state and Theodorsen solution for the system dynamic-state simulation. The source of nonlinearities in the aerodynamics of bluff bodies is systematically investigated. The simulation of bluff-body aerodynamics based on the Volterra reduced-order modeling scheme is obtained by the convolution of the identified kernels with the external inputs, e.g., turbulent inflow or body motion for aerodynamic or aeroelastic response, respectively. It is demonstrated that the Volterra theory-based nonlinear analysis framework for bluff-body aerodynamics combined with the identification of kernels using CFD promises to capture the salient features of bluff-body aerodynamics and offers an accurate reduced-order approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations with reduced level of computational effort.

Hence, efficient model-based perceptual metrics, operating on the geometry of the meshes being compared, have been recently introduced to control and predict these visual artifacts. However, since the 3D models are ultimately visualized on 2D screens, it seems legitimate to use images of the models (i.e., snapshots from different viewpoints) to evaluate their visual fidelity. In this work we investigate the use of image metrics to assess the visual quality of 3D models. For this goal, we conduct a wide-ranging study involving several 2D metrics, rendering algorithms, lighting conditions and pooling algorithms, as well as several mean opinion score databases. The collected data allow (1) to determine the best set of parameters to use for this image-based quality assessment approach and (2) to compare this approach to the best performing model-based metrics and determine for which use-case they are respectively adapted. We conclude by exploring several applications that illustrate the benefits of image-based quality assessment.

543,"A brief overview of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of bridge decks is presented, highlighting special VIV features concerning bridge decks. A popular VIV model (Van der Pol-type model) for bridge decks is examined in detail. Alternatively, a truncated Volterra series-based nonlinear oscillator is introduced to model the VIV system. Typical features of VIV such as the limit cycle oscillation (LCO), frequency shift, hysteresis, and beat phenomenon are parsimoniously and accurately captured in the proposed nonlinear model. As a functional expansion of a nonlinear system, the Volterra series is convenient for estimating the linear and nonlinear contributions to VIV. It is demonstrated that the relative contribution of nonlinear effects in VIV is around 50% of the total response for a range of bridge cross sections. The efficacy of the Volterra series as a reduced-order model (ROM) in capturing aerodynamic nonlinearities eliminates the need for reliance on conventional phenomenological models as it promises to offer a unified framework for nonlinear wind effects on long-span bridgesfor example, VIV, buffeting, and flutter.

548,"A novel dimensionality reduction method named nonlocal and local structure preserving projection (NLLSPP) is proposed and used for process monitoring. NLLSPP can simultaneously preserve the nonlocal structure (i.e., data variance) and the local structure (i.e., neighborhood relationships between data points) of the data set. According to nonadjacent or neighboring relationships of different pairs of data points, NLLSPP defines nonlocal or local similarity weight coefficients for pairwise data points on the basis of their distances. The nonlocal similarity weight coefficients force two nonadjacent data points to be projected far apart from each other. The local similarity weight coefficients force two neighboring data points to be projected near each other. In this way, nonlocal and local structures of the data set are naturally preserved and highlighted in a lower-dimensional space. Because of this advantage, NLLSPP is more powerful than principal component analysis (PCA) and locality preserving projections (LPP) in extracting important data characteristics. A process monitoring method is developed based on the NLLSPP algorithm. Its advantages are illustrated by a case study on the Tennessee Eastman process. The results indicate that the NLLSPP-based method has better monitoring performance that the PCA-based and LPP-based methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

APOLLO enables purely autonomous node deployment as it only entails localized computations. We prove the termination of the algorithm and the (local) optimality of the output. We also show that our optimization objective is closely related to other frequently considered objectives for 2-D area coverage.

550,"A host of mining practices produce fine-grained mineral sludge, such as mature fine tailing from oil-sand extraction. These sludges are hard to dewater because of their high clay content and their low hydraulic conductivity. This paper describes pressure filtration tests in which eight different nonwoven geotextiles (GTXs) were used to filter high-clay-content sludges. The sludges were formulated by mixing kaolinite and silt to obtain eight different grain-size distributions (GSDs) with d(50) ranging from 3 to 55 mu m and clay content ranging from 0% to 38% (d < 2 mu m). The sludges created for this research had the GSD and variability of real fine tailings. The results indicate that sludges can be filtered with nonwoven GTXs selected on the basis of their pore-opening size. Furthermore, calendered GTXs are more efficient in retaining particles than needle punched GTXs. In addition, only during the early stage of filtration do GTXs really influence filtering because it is at this stage that, by retaining coarser particles, they allow progressive formation of filter cake. Upon forming, the filter cake becomes the major contributor to particle retention. Finally, the sludge composition is found to be the most significant factor affecting the final state of dewatering.

The stably transfected mast cell line p815 was then constructed. GFP positive cells were successfully transfected cells. We determined the expression of miR-490-5p in p815 mast cells before and after transfection using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, after transduction with the lentivirus vectors, the role of miR-490-5p in mast cell proliferation and apoptosis was investigated using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The mRNA levels of tryptase and PAR-2 were detected by qRT-PCR and the protein levels were detected by Western blot. RESULTS The inhibition of miR-490-5p expression promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of p815 mast cells. The mRNA levels of tryptase and PAR-2 were significantly increased after transfection compared with the control group, tryptase (P = 0.721, normal vs null; P = 0.001, siRNA vs normal; P = 0.002, siRNA vs null) and PAR-2 (P = 0.027, siRNA vs null; P = 0.353, normal vs null; P = 0.105, siRNA vs normal).

The model aims to predict non-linear power delivery dynamics, given charge and discharge demand as a controllable input, not only in normal operating range of batteries, but also in extreme cases such as battery over-charging. In order to achieve that, the model is composed of separated voltage and current models. Several non-linear models, including Hammerstein model, non-linear open-circuit voltage characteristics, and Takacs hysteresis model are combined in the voltage and the current model, respectively. The state of charge of the battery can also be estimated in a recursive optimization fashion by the model. The parameterization and estimation methods of the model are described and also demonstrated on experimental data from a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cell. The experiment validation shows excellent agreement between measured and simulated voltage and current signals provided by the model during both normal operating and over-charging conditions.

How ancient grains have positive effects is not entirely known, the fragmentation of the scientific knowledge being also related to the fact that ancient grains are not a homogeneous category. The KAMUT((R)) trademark indicates a specific and ancient variety of grain (Triticum turgidum ssp. turanicum, commonly khorasan wheat), and guarantees certain attributes making studies sufficiently comparable. In this work, studies on KAMUT((R)) khorasan wheat have been systematically reviewed, evidencing different aspects supporting its benefits. Although it is not possible to establish whether all ancient grains share these positive characteristics, in total or in part, this review provides further evidences supporting the consumption of ancient grains.

557,"A quantum key distribution protocol with traditional Bob has been proposed recently by Boyer et al. using single-particle state. In this paper, a semi-quantum key distribution protocol is described, in which Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs of particles are utilized to generate a secret key in remote places. This extends the quantum key distribution protocol with traditional Bob where the single-qubit channel is replaced by the entangled EPR-pair channel. And quantum Alice is able to do any quantum operations, preparing quantum states and performing quantum measurement, but traditional Bob is not able to prepare and measure a particle in the computational basis, reflect the particles. Furthermore, entanglement states are used in our protocol. The analysis shows that our protocol is secure, which can avoid the beam splitter attack automatically, and the proposed protocol is more efficient than Boyers scheme.

558,"Age- and disease (osteoporotic fractured and osteoarthritic tissue)-related changes in the distribution of cortical bone were examined, using a multimodality approach, including measurement of local density, geometry and mechanical properties, where changes in these properties can give rise to instability and increasing probability of fracture. In contrast to the majority of previously reported research, this study also focuses on the characteristic non-circular femoral neck cross-sectional geometry and variation in bone mineral density (BMD) around the femoral neck. Twenty-two osteoarthritic and 7 osteoporotic femoral neck slices, collected from elective and trauma-related arthroplasty, and 16 cadaveric donor tissue controls were tested mechanically using Reference Point Indentation (BioDent (TM), Active Life Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA) and then scanned with in vitro-based radiography intended to replicate the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry technique. All parameters were measured regionally around the circumference of the femoral neck, allowing examination of spatial variability within the cortical bone. Fractured tissue was less resistant to indentation in the thinner superolateral segment compared to other segments and other groups. BMD around the fractured femoral necks appeared more consistent than that of nonfractured tissue, where BMD was reduced in the superolateral segment for the other groups. Cortical bone was thin in the superolateral segment for all groups except for the osteoarthritic group, and was thicker in the inferomedial segment for both osteoarthritic and fractured groups, resulting in the largest variation in buckling ratio (ratio of cortical bone diameter to cortical bone thickness) around the femoral neck for the fractured group. With age, healthy controls appeared to have lower inferomedial cortical thickness, whereas no significant differences in Reference Point Indentation measurements and density were observed. The study has highlighted several (both quality- and quantity-related) parameters that may be used to improve prediction of fracture risk.

559,"A generalized predictive closed-loop control strategy to improve the basal ganglia activity patterns in Parkinson's disease (PD) is explored in this paper. Based on system identification, an input-output model is established to reveal the relationship between external stimulation and neuronal responses. The model contributes to the implementation of the generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm that generates the optimal stimulation waveform to modulate the activities of neuronal nuclei. By analyzing the roles of two critical control parameters within the GPC law, optimal closed-loop control that has the capability of restoring the normal relay reliability of the thalamus with the least stimulation energy expenditure can be achieved. In comparison with open-loop deep brain stimulation and traditional static control schemes, the generalized predictive closed-loop control strategy can optimize the stimulation waveform without requiring any particular knowledge of the physiological properties of the system. This type of closed-loop control strategy generates an adaptive stimulation waveform with low energy expenditure with the potential to improve the treatments for PD.

560,"An integrated model for simulating and diagnosing water quality based on the system dynamics and Bayesian network (BN) is presented in the paper. The research aims to connect water monitoring downstream with outlet management upstream in order to present an efficiency outlet management strategy. The integrated model was built from two components: the system dynamics were used to simulate the water quality and the BN was applied to diagnose the reason for water quality deterioration according to the water quality simulation. The integrated model was applied in a case study of the Songhua River from the Baiqi section to the Songlin section to prove its reasonability and accuracy. The results showed that the simulation fit to the variation trend of monitoring data, and the average relative error was less than 10%. The water quality deterioration in the Songlin section was mainly found to be caused by the water quality in the upper reach and Hadashan Reservoir drain by using the diagnosis function of the integrated model based on BN. The relevant result revealed that the integrated model could provide reasonable and quantitative support for the basin manager to make a reasonable outlet control strategy to avoid more serious water quality deterioration.

563,"A novel vacuum ice slurry producing system with jet-pumps was proposed to deal with the problems of high energy consumption and ice blockage. In this novel system, one steam driven by a jet-pump was used to create vacuum in a hermetic vessel where water was sprayed through a nozzle to produce ice slurry, while the other steam was used to provide enough cold energy to make the left vapor in the hermetic vessel condense. Mathematical models of this novel system were established and theoretical simulation on the performance characteristics was also implemented based on the MATLAB program. Results show that the novel system is feasible and practicable, and the system performance is affected by many factors, such as the temperature of the generators, condensing temperature, evaporation temperature, and the cooling load of the refrigerator sub-system.

The SAR ADC is targeted for bridge type pressure sensor in wireless sensor node applications. An improved cascaded inverter based comparator is used for its lower power consumption at reduced supply voltage of 1.3 V. A modified SAR digital circuit has been incorporated to accommodate a higher input range of 1.8 V for the ADC . For a given noise floor, the higher input range of ADC ensures enhanced SNR performance relaxing the constraint on sensor interface circuit preceding to the ADC. Also a novel switching scheme is used in the feedback of comparator to reduce the charge injection induced offset without sacrificing the useful bandwidth of ADC. The inverter based comparator consumes 2 A mu W of power while operating at a speed of 1.6 MHz. The comparator does not make use of any offset cancellation techniques. By suitably choosing the capacitor array of inherent DAC, the calibration techniques have been avoided for the ADC. The ADC achieves an effective number of bits of 10.01 while consuming 6.69 A mu W at a conversion speed of 100 KHz. The FOM of the whole ADC is found to be 64.8 fJ/conversion-step.

566,"A pisotriquetral (semilateral) view of the wrist may improve the assessment of pisotriquetral osteoarthritis (OA), but its reliability and reproducibility are unclear. The purpose of this cross-sectional observer study was to investigate (1) the inter- and intraobserver agreement of evaluating pisotriquetral OA using pisotriquetral views with a special focus on sclerosis, joint space width (JSW) narrowing and osteophyte formation, and (2) the incidence of these latter radiographic features in patients suspected for pisotriquetral OA. Five independent observers rated independently at two different occasions 27 pisotriquetral views from patients treated for ulnar-sided wrist pain suspected for pisotriquetral OA requiring a pisiform resection. The agreement was calculated using kappa statistic. Agreement between observers ranged from 0.38 (fair) to 0.56 (moderate). Average intraobserver agreement ranged from 0.43 (moderate) to 0.52 (moderate). In 36% of the ratings, JSW narrowing was observed, followed by osteophyte formation (30%) and sclerosis (28%). Observers found it especially difficult to detect JSW narrowing. Despite the availability of a pisotriquetral view to enhance visualization of the pisotriquetral joint, assessment of the specific features indicating pisotriquetral OA leads to only fair-to-moderate agreement. This limits the applicability of a radiographic assessment. A rationale for a more reliable radiologic approach in assessing the level of pisotriquetral OA is needed, which may require the use of more advanced imaging techniques.

567,"A Non-isothermal jacketed Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is extensively used in chemical as well as in other process industries to manufacture different products. The dynamics of non-isothermal CSTR are highly nonlinear and open-loop unstable in nature. Moreover, it may have parametric uncertainties, disturbances and un-modeled side reactions which may cause the reactor temperature to deviate from the reference value. This deviation may degrade quality of the product because the chemical reaction inside the CSTR depends on reactor temperature. For such a nonlinear, unstable and uncertain process, designing a control scheme with the ability to reject the effects of disturbances along with a good reference tracking capability is a challenging control engineering problem. In this work, a novel robust sliding mode control technique named as Improved Integral Sliding Mode Control (IISMC) has been presented for uncertain non-isothermal jacketed CSTR process. Moreover, a variety of recently developed sliding mode control techniques such as Classical Integral Sliding Mode Control (CISMC) and Super Twisted Algorithm based Sliding Mode Control (STA-SMC) have also been devised and compared with the proposed approach in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. A Lyapunov based analysis has also been provided to assure the robust stability of the closed loop process. Furthermore, in order to extend the state feedback approach to the output feedback scheme, two robust observers; High Gain Observer (HGO) and Extended High Gain Observer (EHGO), are also designed for the very process. They have also been compared with each other and have been investigated for robust stability using Lyapunov based approach. Finally, an output feedback control scheme using IISMC and EHGO has been presented and its performance has been examined and compared with the IISMC based state feedback approach. The simulation results show that the proposed control scheme effectively rejects the uncertainties and disturbances without leading the process to instability and offers good reference tracking capabilities.

570,"Addictions, including alcohol use disorders, are characterized by the loss of control over drug seeking and consumption, but the neural circuits and signaling mechanisms responsible for the transition from controlled use to uncontrolled abuse remain incompletely understood. Prior studies have shown that compulsive-like' behaviors in rodents, for example, persistent responding for ethanol (EtOH) despite punishment, are increased after chronic exposure to EtOH. The main goal of the current study was to assess the effects of chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) exposure on multiple, putative measures of compulsive-like EtOH seeking in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were exposed to two or four weekly cycles of CIE and then, post-withdrawal, tested for progressive ratio responding for EtOH, sustained responding during signaled EtOH unavailability and (footshock) punished suppression of responding for EtOH. Results showed that mice exposed to CIE exhibited attenuated suppression of EtOH seeking during punishment, as compared with air-exposed controls. By contrast, CIE exposure affected neither punished food reward-seeking behavior, nor other putative measures of compulsive-like EtOH seeking. Ex vivo reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of brain tissue found reduced sensitivity to punished EtOH seeking after CIE exposure was accompanied by a significant increase in gene expression of the GluN1 and GluN2A subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, specifically in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, slice electrophysiological analysis revealed increased N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated currents in the orbitofrontal cortex after CIE exposure in test-naive mice. Collectively, the current findings add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating that chronic exposure to EtOH fosters resistance to punished EtOH seeking in association with adaptations in cortical glutamatergic transmission.

The dynamic response of the system under consideration is also studied and analysed in the presence of non-linear constraints namely generation rate constraint with reheat steam turbine, governor deadband and time delay during signal processing. Further, in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DOGSA tuning over the genetic algorithm and differential evolution tuned schemes reported in the literature, it is also employed to tune the integral (I), proportional-integral (PI), integral-derivative (ID) and proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers. Moreover, the performance of the optimised SMC scheme is also compared with I, PI, ID and PID controllers.

Data were used from 717 participants in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Average age was 55.4 years (standard deviation = 2.5). Significant positive associations were observed between free testosterone level and verbal episodic memory, as well as a significant interaction between free testosterone and APOE-epsilon 4 status. In epsilon 4 carriers free testosterone was positively associated with verbal episodic memory performance (story recall), whereas no association was observed in epsilon 4 noncarriers. Results support the hypothesis that APOE-epsilon 4 status increases susceptibility to other risk factors, such as low testosterone, which may ultimately contribute to cognitive decline or dementia.

The current industrial practice is to develop and maintain these variants separately. Any potential change has to be applied across variants manually, which is neither efficient nor scalable. We consider the problem of supporting multiple platforms as a 'software product-line engineering' problem. The paper proposes a novel application of product-line model-driven engineering to mobile application development and addresses the key challenges of feature-based native mobile application variants for multiple platforms. Specifically, we deal with three types of variations in mobile applications: variation due to operation systems and their versions, software and hardware capabilities of mobile devices, and functionalities offered by the mobile application. We develop a tool MOPPET that automates the proposed approach. Finally, the results of applying the approach on two industrial case studies show that the proposed approach is applicable to industrial mobile applications and have potential to significantly reduce the development effort and time.

579,"A method is developed for reducing the power inverter electrical circuit of fourth order to an electrical network of second order. The reduction is based on the assumption that the output inverter voltage is practically with a sine-wave shape. The normalized form guarantees novelty and versatility of the investigation on one hand and independency in relation to the concrete inverter parameters like output power, supplying voltage and operating frequency on the other. From the whole power network of fourth order for the first time two sub circuits are suggested to be outlined: the output (load) sub circuit and the inverter commutating sub circuit. Both sub circuits of a second order define the parameters of the endmost inverter circuit again of the same order and consequently the mode of operation and parameters of the power inverter itself. The transformation is possible owing to the newly found fact that the frequency dependencies of the output (load) sub circuit can be separated from the dependencies that describe the structural relationships between the two sub circuits. The results from that conversion are of course more accurate when the resonant frequencies of the both sub circuits and the operating frequency do not differ substantially. The suggested approach is useful on order to obtain a simplified engineer method for precise and fast design of large class of static power converters applicable in electronic technology like induction heating and melting.

580,"A shared approach to decision-making framework has been suggested for chronic disease management especially where multiple treatment options exist. Shared decision-making (SDM) requires that both physician and patients are actively engaged in the decision-making process, including information exchange; expressing treatment preferences; as well as agreement over the final treatment decision. Although SDM appears well supported by patients, practitioners and policymakers alike, the current challenge is to determine how best to make SDM a reality in everyday clinical practice. Within the context of asthma, adherence rates are poor and are linked to outcomes such as reduced asthma control, increased symptoms, healthcare expenditures, and lower patient quality of life. It has been suggested that SDM can improve treatment adherence and that ignoring patients' personal goals and preferences may result in reduced rates of adherence. Furthermore, understanding predictors of poor treatment adherence is a necessary step toward developing effective strategies to improve the patient-reported and clinically important outcomes. Here, we describe why a shared approach to treatment decision-making for asthma has the potential to be an effective tool for improving adherence, with associated clinical and patient-related outcomes. In addition, we explore insights into the reasons why SDM has not been implemented into routine clinical practice.

Starting with the full length of the unknown echo path, the start-tap and end-tap estimates of the active region adapt, respectively, in the form of fractional tap. The effective tap-length estimate is defined by the length between the start-tap and end-tap estimates. The filter tap-weight vector is then updated with this effective tap-length estimate following the NLMS algorithm, while the tap weights located beyond the effective tap-length estimate are directly set to zero. In case that the active region of the unknown echo path shifts in a large scale, the start-tap and end-tap estimates are reset to the full length when the effective tap-length estimate is lower than a predetermined threshold value. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed fractional tap-based algorithm can efficiently locate and track the effective tap length of the unknown echo path when the active coefficients change abruptly in locations and magnitudes, outperforming the existing stochastic tap-based schemes.

Currently, the annual fisheries catch averages 3.44 +/- 0.50 Mt. Most comes from marine capture 1.95 +/- 0.46 Mt, followed by coastal aquaculture 0.78 +/- 0.09 Mt, freshwater aquaculture 0.49 +/- 0.05 Mt, and inland capture 0.22 +/- 0.01 Mt. Of this total, about 11% is contained in fresh products directly sold in local markets for consumption, while 89% is sent to processing factories prior to being sold in local markets and exported. The quantities of P entering the fisheries sector come from captures, import of fisheries products and feed produced from agriculture. This P input to the fisheries sector is found to average 28,506 t P.y(-1) based on the past ten-year records. Of this total, P input from captures accounts for 76%; while, 11% represents aquatic feeds from agriculture and animal manures. About 13% is obtained from the imports of fishery products. Coastal and freshwater aquacultures are found to be P consumers because their feeds are almost all produced from agricultural crops grown inland.

Overall, P in the fisheries sector is found to mobilize through three channels: (a) 44% is consumed within the country; (b) about 16% is exported; and, (c) 40% is lost from the ecosystem. Based on the results of this work it is recommended that future research be directed on ways to minimize P loss and maximize P recycle in Thailand's fisheries sector as to enhance its food security and curtail water pollution.

589,"A generic rainwater harvesting system including a catchment area and a command area is often equipped with rainwater storage tanks. The stochastic nature of precipitation dominates water balance of rainwater harvesting systems, and the theory of stochastic control better serves for determining optimal strategies for water management. A mathematical model consisting of stochastic differential equations, with few model parameters that can be identified from observed data, is developed to describe dynamics of rainwater harvesting systems for irrigation. Stochastic control problems are formulated and then solved to obtain the optimal irrigation strategies during dry spells. This procedure can be inversely applicable to designing dimensions of a system. Identification of the model parameters is demonstrated with the data observed in an experimental micro rainwater harvesting system in Japan as well as in semiarid savanna of Ghana. Then, a real life application is discussed in the context of the Jordan Rift Valley, where a rainwater harvesting system will be developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

590,"A fundamental process in construction cost estimation is the appropriate adjustment of costs to reflect project location. Unfortunately, location adjustment factors are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use adjustment factors from adjacent locations, referred to as the nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions, which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location adjustment factors where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location adjustment factors was evaluated against an established cost index database, and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location adjustment factors. When compared with NN and other alternative proximity-based location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25-40% reduction of the median absolute error. This work contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a more accurate method for estimating location adjustment factors which can improve cost estimates for construction projects where location adjustment factors do not currently exist.

591,"Air pollution has been a major environment-related health threat. Most of the studies on PM2.5 toxicity have verified on the cardiovascular system and endothelial cells. However, researches on PM2.5-induced myocardial-related toxicity are limited. This study aims to fully understand the toxic effects of PM2.5 on human myocardial cell (AC16) and explore its molecular mechanism based on microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis. Microarray data analysis manifested that PM2.5-induced toxicity affected expression of 472 genes compared with the control group, including 166 upregulated genes and 306 downregulated genes in human myocardial (AC16) cells. GO analysis showed that cellular processes such as immune response, cell maturation, embryonic heart tube morphogenesis, cellular response to electrical stimulus, skeletal muscle tissue regeneration, and negative regulation of signal transduction were upregulated, while regulation of transcription (DNA-dependent), rhythmic process, protein destabilization apoptotic process, and innate immune response were downregulated. The pathway analysis indicates that cell signaling pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, HTLV-I infection, and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were upregulated, while the TGF-beta signaling pathway was downregulated. In addition, Signal-net showed that the TUBA4A, ADRBK2, BRIX1, SMC4, EIF5B, PRMT1, ATG4B, and NDC80 genes were significantly decreased, while the expression of the KRT6B gene was markedly increased compared with the control group. All the genes were verified by qRT-PCR. This study had provided new bioinformatics evidences in PM2.5-induced myocardial tissue toxicity which is necessary for further cardiovascular system toxicity studies.

The morphology, structure and electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes were characterised by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, UV-visible absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, Raman spectra and cyclic voltammetry. The dynamic light scattering, transmission electronic microscopy and spectrophotometric measurements all showed good distribution of the quantum dots with a small particle size. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated the high performance of the composite response in the presence of a light source. Differential pulse voltammetry allowed the development of a method to determine 17-estradiol levels in the range from 0.2 to 4.0molL(-1) with a detection limit of 2.8nmolL(-1) (0.76gL(-1)).

Energy savings can be achieved in the building sector by improving the building's dynamic energy performance in terms of sustainable construction management in the urban-based built environments (referred to as an ""Urban Organism""). This study implements the concept of ""dynamic approach"" to reflect the unexpected changes in the climate and energy environments as well as in the energy policies and technologies. Research in this area is very significant for the future of the building, energy, and environmental industries around the world. However, there is a lack of studies from the perspective of the dynamic approach and the system integration, and thus, this study is designed to fill the research gap. This study highlights the state-of-the-art in the major phases for a building's dynamic energy performance (i.e., monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting phases), focusing on the operation and maintenance phase. This study covers a wide range of research works and provides various illustrative examples of the monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting of a building's dynamic energy performance. Finally, this study proposes the specific future developments and challenges by phase and suggests the future direction of system integration for the development of a carbon-integrated management system as a large complex system.

594,"A microstructure-based modeling method is developed to predict the mechanical behaviors of lithium ion battery separators. Existing battery separator modeling methods cannot capture the structural features on the microscale. To overcome this issue, we propose an image-based microstructure Representative Volume Element (RVE) modeling method, which facilitates the understanding of the separators complex macro mechanical behaviors from the perspective of microstructural features. A generic image processing workflow is developed to identify different phases in the microscopic image. The processed RVE image supplies microstructural information to the Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Both mechanical behavior and microstructure evolution are obtained from the simulation. The evolution of microstructure features is quantified using the stochastic microstructure characterization methods. The proposed method successfully captures the anisotropic behavior of the separator under tensile test, and provides insights into the microstructure deformation, such as the growth of voids. We apply the proposed method to a commercially available separator as the demonstration. The analysis results are validated using experimental testing results that are reported in literature.

595,"A darknet monitoring system is developed to grasp malicious activities on the Internet in an early stage and to cope with them. The darknet monitoring system consists of network sensors deployed widely on the Internet. The sensors capture incoming unsolicited packets. A goal of this system analyzes captured malicious packets and provides effective information for protecting good Internet users from malicious activities. To provide effective and reliable information, sensors must be deployed in secret and hidden from outside. On the other hand, attackers intend to detect sensors for evading them. This attempt is known as localization attacks to darknet monitoring systems. If actual location of sensors is revealed to attackers, it is almost impossible to grasp the latest tactics used by attackers. Thus in our previous work, we proposed a packet sampling method, which samples incoming packets based on an attribute of packets sender, to increase a tolerance to a localization attack and to keep a high quality of information publicized by the system. As a result, we almost succeeded to counter from a localization attack, which generates spike on the publicized graph to detect a sensor. However in some cases, proposed sampling method works to attacker's advantage and spikes appear clearly on the graph. Therefore, we propose advanced sampling methods, which sample incoming packets based on multiple attributes of packets sender. In this paper, we present our improved methods and show a promising evaluation result obtained from the simulation.

597,"Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is a mature hydrogen production technology and there exists a range of economic assessments for available technologies. For advanced AWEs, which may be based on novel polymer-based membrane concepts, it is of prime importance that development comes along with new configurations and technical and economic key process parameters for AWE that might be of interest for further economic assessments. This paper presents an advanced AWE technology referring to three different sites in Europe (Germany, Austria, and Spain). The focus is on financial metrics, the projection of key performance parameters of advanced AWEs, and further financial and tax parameters. For financial analysis from an investor's (business) perspective, a comprehensive assessment of a technology not only comprises cost analysis but also further financial analysis quantifying attractiveness and supply/market flexibility. Therefore, based on cash flow (CF) analysis, a comprehensible set of metrics may comprise levelised cost of energy or, respectively, levelized cost of hydrogen (LCH) for cost assessment, net present value (NPV) for attractiveness analysis, and variable cost (VC) for analysis of market flexibility. The German AWE site turns out to perform best in all three financial metrics (LCH, NPV, and VC). Though there are slight differences in investment cost and operation and maintenance cost projections for the three sites, the major cost impact is due to the electricity cost. Although investment cost is slightly lower and labor cost is significantly lower in Spain, the difference can not outweigh the higher electricity cost compared to Germany. Given the assumption that the electrolysis operators are customers directly and actively participating in power markets, and based on the regulatory framework in the three countries, in this special case electricity cost in Germany is lowest. However, as electricity cost is profoundly influenced by political decisions as well as the implementation of economic instruments for transforming electricity systems toward sustainability, it is hardly possible to further improve electricity price forecasts.

598,"A statistical analysis and inter-comparison of the solar radiation at two sites in Cyprus representing two different climate regimes of the island (Athalassa-inland plain vs Larnaca-coastal location) covering the period January 2013-December 2015 is presented. Mean annual and mean monthly daily totals of the global, horizontal beam and diffuse radiation and their frequency distribution at both sites are computed and discussed. The values of skewness and kurtosis coefficients are used to define the frequency distribution type of the above radiation parameters on a monthly basis. The statistical analysis is extended to the daily clearness index (K-T), diffuse ratio (K-D), and the ratio of horizontal beam to global radiation (K-B,K-G). Furthermore, the influencing factors on the magnitude of the radiation components were examined. The value of K-T was used to classify three different types of days such as clear, partially cloudy and cloudy days. Then, a statistical analysis of the solar radiation components was performed. On an average annual basis, more than 80% of the days are classified as either clear or partially cloudy at both stations. Additionally, the influence of the atmospheric absorption and scattering of the solar radiation under clear skies was examined on the basis of the Linke turbidity factor (T-L). The results of this analysis are used to characterize and compare the radiation regimes of the two sites. Both sites have relatively high intensity of global and direct horizontal radiation. The annual average daily global radiation intensity is 18.5 MJ m(-2) at Athalassa and 19.9 MJ m(-2) at Larnaca. The horizontal beam radiation is 13.1 MJ m(-2) for Athalassa and 14.2 MJ m(-2) for Larnaca. Therefore, the fraction of the beam component of the global radiation is comparatively high at both sites, as indicated by the annual average daily fraction which is greater than 0.600. Generally, Larnaca has slightly higher rates of global radiation than Athalassa, as indicated by the average yearly cumulative global irradiation which is 6763 MJ m(-2) for Athalassa and 7274 MJ m(-2) for Larnaca.

Attempts to identify cellular activators of PPAR delta produced large lists of various fatty acids and their metabolic derivatives; however, there is no consensus on specific and selective binding interactions of natural ligands with PPAR delta. Most models on binding interactions within the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPAR delta have been derived from analyses of PPAR delta-LBD crystals formed with synthetic low molecular weight ligands. Nonetheless, crystals of the whole receptor with natural ligands or of its heterodimer with its cognate retinoid X receptor (RXR) are not yet available for analysis. We have found that 4-hydroxyalkenals, non-enzymatic peroxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), namely, 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE) and 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE), activate PPAR delta in vascular endothelial cells and insulin-secreting beta cells, respectively.

In this paper, we analyze the relationship between fractal Brownian motion and atmospheric turbulence firstly. Then based on the classical fractal algorithm, a new algorithm is proposed to generate a rectangular phase screen, which combines the random midpoint displacement (RMD) principle with the successive random additions (SRA) technique. It mainly contains three interpolation methods including square interpolation, trigonometric interpolation and diamond interpolation, respectively. Therefore we call the algorithm (S-T-D)RMD-SRA. We carry out the split-step method to propagate beam through atmospheric turbulence, which is simulated by a rectangular phase screens transmission model. Numerical simulations show that the new algorithm and traditional FFT-based algorithm on the statistical properties are almost consistent with the theoretical value. Furthermore, it has high performance in computation time and parallel efficiency.

Basically, the measurement process consists of three consecutive steps of charge, discharge and charge of the capacitor under test.

Experimental results show that it is possible to measure a wide range of capacitor values with a maximum deviation of 2% from the reference value, and that temperature changes from 18 to 70 degrees C yield relative errors below 0.1%. For the lowest measured capacitor range (33 pF-4.7 nF) the uncertainty holds below 1 pF which enables measurement of commercially available capacitive sensors. The main advantage of the proposed technique is cost and space reduction of the final design.

Our aim is to link the foam's morphological and microstructural features with its mechanical properties thanks to X-ray tomography and finite element (FE). An approach combining X-ray tomography at different resolutions, image processing, and FE modeling was developed to take into account the influence of the intermetallics on the foam's fracture. First, the samples were scanned with ""local"" tomography, where the specimen is placed close to the X-ray source. These images allowed for observing intermetallics. Then an in situ tensile test was performed in the tomograph to follow the sample's deformation at low resolution. The images obtained from local tomography were processed to create one low-resolution image of the initial sample including details from high resolution. This was done by a series of thresholding and scaling of the high-resolution images. This image was used to generate a FE mesh. A FE input file was obtained thanks to Java programs associating the elements to the phases. At the local scale, the calculated stress distribution and the images of the struts were analysed.

609,"Adenosine triphosphate is involved in many metabolic reactions, but it has also a role as a cellular danger signal transmitted through purinergic receptors (PRs). Indeed, adenosine 5;-triphosphate (ATP) can bind to PRs which are found in the membrane of many cell types, although the relative proportions of the receptor subtypes differ. PRs are classified according to genetic and pharmacological criteria and especially their affinities for agonists and their transduction mechanism (i.e. as metabotropic P2YRs or ionotropic P2XRs). Extracellular ATP release by activated or necrotic cells may activate various PRs and especially P2X7R, the best-characterized PR, on immune cells. P2X7R is known to regulate the activation of the Nod-like receptor (NLR)-family protein, NLRP3 inflammasome, which permit the release of IL-1b, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. The P2X7R/NLRP3 pathway is involved in many inflammatory diseases, such as gout, and in fibrosis diseases associated with inflammatory process, liver or lung fibrosis. Some authors imaging also a real promising therapeutic potential of P2X7R blockage. Thus, several pharmaceutical companies have developed P2X7R antagonists as novel anti-inflammatory drug candidates. Clinical trials of the efficacy of these antagonists are now underway. A better understanding of the P2X7R/NLRP3 signalling pathways permits the identification of targets and the development of a new class of drugs able to inhibit the fibrogenesis process and collagen deposition.

610,"A significant challenge in electric vehicles with multiple motors is how to control the individual drivetrains in order to achieve measurable benefits in terms of vehicle cornering response, compared to conventional stability control systems actuating the friction brakes. This paper presents a direct yaw moment controller based on the combination of feedforward and feedback contributions for continuous yaw rate control. When the estimated sideslip exceeds a pre-defined threshold, a sideslip-based yaw moment contribution is activated. All yaw moment contributions are entirely tunable through model-based approaches, for reduced vehicle testing time. The purpose of the controller is to continuously modify the vehicle understeer characteristic in quasi-static conditions and increase yaw and sideslip damping during transients. Skid-pad, step-steer and sweep steer tests are carried out with a front-wheel-drive fully electric vehicle demonstrator with two independent drivetrains. The experimental test results of the electric motor-based actuation of the direct yaw moment controller are compared with those deriving from the friction brake-based actuation of the same algorithm, which is a major contribution of this paper. The novel results show that continuous direct yaw moment control allows significant ""on-demand"" changes of the vehicle response in cornering conditions and to enhance active vehicle safety during extreme driving maneuvers.

Underliners of gravel with some sand or those of gravel and sand caused significant puncturing and excessive strains in the geomembrane for the conditions examined. The shape of the underliner grading curve had a much greater effect on the potential for puncturing and the magnitude of the strains in the geomembrane than just the maximum particle size. Of the six granular underliners examined, the best performance was for the well graded gravelly sand with some silt which offered sufficient support to minimize the strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner while not inducing significant strains directly from the underliner. Nevertheless even in this case the maximum strain of 11% is almost double the maximum recommended in the literature for ensuring good long-term performance of the geomembrane. Consideration of composite liners with GCLs and compacted clay liners shows that the more deformable the foundation, the larger are the indentations and strains induced in the geomembrane by a given overliner. For the specific conditions examined, it is shown that there was no apparent improvement in performance for an LLDPE geomembrane versus the HDPE geomembrane tested. A 540 g/m(2) geotextile protection layer above the geomembrane was also found to be insufficient to prevent significant strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner examined.

This evaluation is obtained by an ad hoc network of sensor nodes, working in conjunction with an ambient intelligence layer embedded in a personal computer that learns from user behaviour patterns and warns when a detected pattern differs significantly from previously acquired normal patterns. Each new datum read from sensors is processed in the ambient intelligence layer through three processing levels: shallow, intermediate and deep. The shallow processing level focuses on physical data and sensory features. The intermediate level covers information interpretation and its translation into the form required by the third level: the reasoning processing or deep level. In alert intelligent device, energy is a critical issue, so that sensor devices need to be properly designed and managed to achieve significant energy saving. The use of bed/chair occupancy sensors is mandatory for this kind of ubiquitous computing system. A first way to approach this problem relied on the use of pressure mats, but several environmental drawbacks showed them inappropriate as an efficient and reliable solution for large volume deployments. Moreover, solutions based on force-to-resistor transducers entail power consumption budgets that keep them from being integrated on wireless sensor nodes. In this paper, a force-capacitive transducer based sensor has been proposed, implemented and tested. This sensor is based on electromechanical film (EMFi) transducers, which are able to detect force variations in a quasi-passive way. This kind of transducer behaves as capacitors with variable capacitance depending on the force exerted on its surface. We have developed a new technique to carry out the characterization of these transducers, where the detection of a force change is used to trigger an active mechanism that allows us to measure the weight by means of a novel modelling approach. A low-power wireless sensor node prototype that includes this new transducer has been assembled and tested on a wide range of weights. Occupancy detection achieved by this technology has proven to be successful, increasing the total power consumption of the node by less than 15%, which makes it suitable for implementation.

Yet, this association may be confounded by facet joint osteoarthritis. BMD may not be a risk factor for lumbar disc degeneration in Chinese. Purpose Evidence suggested that lumbar vertebral bone and intervertebral disc interact with each other in multiple ways. The current paper aims to determine the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and lumbar disc degeneration using a sample of Chinese. Methods We studied 165 patients with back disorders and 347 general subjects from China. All subjects had lumbar spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) spine BMD studies, and a subset of general subjects had additional hip BMD measurements. On T2-weighted MR images, Pfirrmann score was used to evaluate the degree of lumbar disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis was assessed as none, slight-moderate, and severe. Regression analyses were used to examine the associations between lumbar and hip BMD and disc degeneration, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), lumbar region, and facet joint osteoarthritis. Results Greater facet joint osteoarthritis was associated with greater spine BMD (P0.05), and between hip BMD and disc degeneration in general subjects (P >0.05). Conclusion BMD may not be a risk factor for lumbar disc degeneration in Chinese. Facet joint osteoarthritis inflates DXA spine BMD measurements and therefore, may confound the association between spine BMD and disc degeneration.

Dedicated system-identification experiments without feedback control have been carried out to generate data for the development of this model. The data-driven dynamic model, which is both device-specific and scenario-specific, represents the response of the iota profile and beta(N) to the electric field due to induction as well as to the heating and current drive (H&CD) systems during the flat-top phase of an H-mode discharge in DIII-D. The control goal is to use both induction and the H&CD systems to locally regulate the plasma iota profile and beta(N) around particular target values close to the reference state used for system identification. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the plasma model at steady state is carried out to decouple the system and identify the most relevant control channels. A mixed-sensitivity robust control design problem is formulated based on the dynamic model to synthesize a stabilizing feedback controller without input constraints that minimizes the reference tracking error and rejects external disturbances with minimal control energy. The feedback controller is then augmented with an anti-windup compensator, which keeps the given controller well-behaved in the presence of magnitude constraints in the actuators and leaves the nominal closed-loop system unmodified when no saturation is present. The proposed controller represents one of the first feedback profile controllers integrating magnetic and kinetic variables ever implemented and experimentally tested in DIII-D. The preliminary experimental results presented in this work, although limited in number and constrained by actuator problems and design limitations, as it will be reported, show good progress towards routine current profile control in DIII-D and leave valuable lessons for further advancements in the field.

Therefore, how to choose an appropriate software process model is a very important problem for software development. Current works focus on the selection criteria and often lead to subjective results. In this paper, we propose a software process model recommendation method, to help project managers choose the most appropriate software process model for a new project at an early stage of development process according to historical software engineering data. The proposed method casts the process model recommendation into a classification problem. It first evaluates the different combinations of the alternative classification and attribute selection algorithms, and the best one is used to build the recommendation model with historical software engineering data; then, the constructed recommendation model is used to predict process models for a new software project with only a few data. We also analyze the mutual impacts between process models and different types of project factors, to further help managers locate the most suitable process model. We found process models are also responsible for defect count, defect severity and software change. Experiments on the data sets from 37 different development teams of different countries show that the average recommendation accuracy of our method reaches up to 82.5%, which makes it potentially useful in practice.

617,"Aging is associated with an increase in circulating inflammatory factors. One, the cytokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12), is critical to stem cell mobilization, migration, and homing as well as to bone marrow stem cell (BMSC), osteoblast, and osteoclast function. SDF-1 has pleiotropic roles in bone formation and BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts/osteocytes, and in osteoprogenitor cell survival. The objective of this study was to examine the association of plasma SDF-1 in participants in the cardiovascular health study (CHS) with bone mineral density (BMD), body composition, and incident hip fractures. In 1536 CHS participants, SDF-1 plasma levels were significantly associated with increasing age (p < 0.01) and male gender (p = 0.04), but not with race (p = 0.63). In multivariable-adjusted models, higher SDF-1 levels were associated with lower total hip BMD (p = 0.02). However, there was no significant association of SDF-1 with hip fractures (p = 0.53). In summary, circulating plasma levels of SDF-1 are associated with increasing age and independently associated with lower total hip BMD in both men and women. These findings suggest that SDF-1 levels are linked to bone homeostasis.

620,"A smart community is a distributed system consisting of a set of smart homes which utilize the smart home scheduling techniques to enable customers to automatically schedule their energy loads targeting various purposes such as electricity bill reduction. Smart home scheduling is usually implemented in a decentralized fashion inside a smart community, where customers compete for the community level renewable energy due to their relatively low prices. Typically there exists an aggregator as a community wide electricity policy maker aiming to minimize the total electricity bill among all customers. This paper develops a new renewable energy aware pricing scheme to achieve this target. We establish the proof that under certain assumptions the optimal solution of decentralized smart home scheduling is equivalent to that of the centralized technique, reaching the theoretical lower bound of the community wide total electricity bill. In addition, an advanced cross entropy optimization technique is proposed to compute the pricing scheme of renewable energy, which is then integrated in smart home scheduling. The simulation results demonstrate that our pricing scheme facilitates the reduction of both the community wide electricity bill and individual electricity bills compared to the uniform pricing. In particular, the community wide electricity bill can be reduced to only 0.06 percent above the theoretic lower bound.

621,"Abnormal accumulation of TDP-43 into cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions with accompanying nuclear clearance, a common pathology initially identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), has also been found in Alzheimer' disease (AD). TDP-43 serves as a splicing repressor of non-conserved cryptic exons and that such function is compromised in brains of ALS and FTD patients, suggesting that nuclear clearance of TDP-43 underlies its inability to repress cryptic exons. However, whether TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates are a prerequisite for the incorporation of cryptic exons is not known. Here, we assessed hippocampal tissues from 34 human postmortem brains including cases with confirmed diagnosis of AD neuropathologic changes along with age-matched controls. We found that cryptic exon incorporation occurred in all AD cases exhibiting TDP-43 pathology. Furthermore, incorporation of cryptic exons was observed in the hippocampus when TDP-43 inclusions was restricted only to the amygdala, the earliest stage of TDP-43 progression. Importantly, cryptic exon incorporation could be detected in AD brains lacking TDP-43 inclusion but exhibiting nuclear clearance of TDP-43. These data supports the notion that the functional consequence of nuclear depletion of TDP-43 as determined by cryptic exon incorporation likely occurs as an early event of TDP-43 proteinopathy and may have greater contribution to the pathogenesis of AD than currently appreciated. Early detection and effective repression of cryptic exons in AD patients may offer important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for this devastating illness of the elderly.

622,"Activating Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) mutations have been discovered in many T-cell malignancies, including anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). However, such mutations occur in a minority of patients. To investigate the clinical application of targeting JAK for ALK-ALCL, we treated ALK-cell lines of various histological origins with JAK inhibitors. Interestingly, most exogenous cytokine-independent cell lines responded to JAK inhibition regardless of JAK mutation status. JAK inhibitor sensitivity correlated with the STAT3 phosphorylation status of tumor cells. Using retroviral shRNA knockdown, we have demonstrated that these JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells are dependent on both JAK1 and STAT3 for survival. JAK1 and STAT3 gain-of-function mutations were found in some, but not all, JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells. Moreover, the mutations alone cannot explain the JAK1/STAT3 dependency, given that wildtype JAK1 or STAT3 was sufficient to promote cell survival in the cells that had either JAK1or STAT3 mutations. To investigate whether other mechanisms were involved, we knocked down upstream receptors GP130 or IL-2R gamma. Knockdown of GP130 or IL-2R. induced cell death in selected JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells. High expression levels of cytokines, including IL-6, were demonstrated in cell lines as well as in primary ALK-ALCL tumors. Finally, ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was effective in vivo in a xenograft ALK-ALCL model. Our data suggest that cytokine receptor signaling is required for tumor cell survival in diverse forms of ALK-ALCL, even in the presence of JAK1/STAT3 mutations. Therefore, JAK inhibitor therapy might benefit patients with ALK-ALCL who are phosphorylated STAT3(+).

624,"Alzheimer's disease is a complex progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder, being its prevalence expected to rise over the next decades. Unconventional strategies for elucidating the genetic mechanisms are necessary due to its polygenic nature. In this work, the input information sources are five: a public DNA microarray that measures expression levels of control and patient samples, repositories of known genes associated to Alzheimer's disease, additional data, Gene Ontology and finally, a literature review or expert knowledge to validate the results. As methodology to identify genes highly related to this disease, we present the integration of three machine learning techniques: particularly, we have used decision trees, quantitative association rules and hierarchical cluster to analyze Alzheimer's disease gene expression profiles to identify genes highly linked to this neurodegenerative disease, through changes in their expression levels between control and patient samples. We propose an ensemble of decision trees and quantitative association rules to find the most suitable configurations of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm GarNet, in order to overcome the complex parametrization intrinsic to this type of algorithms. To fulfill this goat, GarNet has been executed using multiple configuration settings and the well-known C4.5 has been used to find the minimum accuracy to be satisfied. Then, GarNet is rerun to identify dependencies between genes and their expression levels, so we are able to distinguish between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients using the configurations that overcome the minimum threshold of accuracy defined by C4.5 algorithm. Finally, a hierarchical cluster analysis has been used to validate the obtained gene-Alzheimer's Disease associations provided by GarNet The results have shown that the obtained rules were able to successfully characterize the underlying information, grouping relevant genes for Alzheimer Disease. The genes reported by our approach provided two well defined groups that perfectly divided the samples between healthy and Alzheimer's Disease patients. To prove the relevance of the obtained results, a statistical test and gene expression fold-change were used. Furthermore, this relevance has been summarized in a volcano plot, showing two clearly separated and significant groups of genes that are up or down-regulated in Alzheimer's Disease patients. A biological knowledge integration phase was performed based on the information fusion of systematic literature review, enrichment Gene Ontology terms for the described genes found in the hippocampus of patients. Finally, a validation phase with additional data and a permutation test is carried out, being the results consistent with previous studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

625,"A novel digital envelope modulator for envelope tracking radio frequency power amplifier is presented in this paper. The proposed modulator consists of a parallel combination of linear class AB and switching class D power amplifiers that are controlled digitally. In the previous analog architectures, the requirements needed for the AB operational amplifier such as high-current driving capability, high bandwidth and large output swing is usually obtainable at high overall static power dissipation. The digitally controlled power opamp presented here not only provides the aforementioned requirements but also reduces power dissipation compared with previous work. Furthermore, the digital control of the modulator makes it adaptive to the input signal variations in comparison with conventional analog parallel hybrid envelope modulators. The digital processor of the modulator is evaluated with a 45-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The overall power consumption of the digital processor is around 142mW at 1.5-GHz clock frequency. As an application, the designed digital class AB is incorporated in a complete envelope modulator architecture. The overall efficiency of the modulator, including the digital processor power consumption, is around 82% at an average 32dBm output power for a 5-MHz input signal.

However, the experimental assessment of vision-based forensic algorithms is a particularly critical task, since they cannot be tested on massive amounts of data, and their performance can heavily depend on user skill. In this paper we investigate on the accuracy and reliability of a vision-based, user-supervised method for the estimation of the camera principal point, to be used in cropping and splicing detection. Results of an extensive experimental evaluation show how the estimation accuracy depends on perspective conditions as well as on the selected image features. Such evidence led us to define a novel visual feature, referred to as Minimum Vanishing Angle, which can be used to assess the reliability of the method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

627,"A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypopituitarism following an acute presentation with cardiac tamponade and hyponatraemia, having recently been investigated for a pericardial effusion. Secondary hypothyroidism is a rare cause of pericardial effusion and tamponade, but an important differential to consider. Management requires appropriate hormone replacement and, critically, a low threshold for commencing stress dose steroids. Clinical signs classically associated with cardiac tamponade are frequently absent in cases of tamponade due to primary and secondary hypothyroidism, and the relatively volume deplete state of secondary hypoadrenalism in hypopituitarism may further mask an evolving tamponade, as the rise in right atrial pressure is less marked even in the presence of large effusion. Our case demonstrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for cardiac tamponade in this patient cohort, even in the absence of clinical signs, and for measuring both thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels when evaluating a pericardial effusion.

628,"Aging is a cause of cognitive decline in the elderly and the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, however, aging people are not all destined to develop into cognitive deficits, the molecular mechanisms underlying this difference in cognition of aging people are obscure. Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation in the nervous system, play a critical role in regulation of gene expression for learning and memory. An inhibitor of acetyltransferases (INHAT) is reported to suppress histone acetylation via a histone-masking mechanism, and pp32 is a key component of INHAT complex. In the present study, we divided 18 m-old aged mice into the cognitive-normal and the cognitive-impaired group by Morris water maze, and found that pp32 level was significantly increased in the hippocampus of cognitive-impaired aged mice. The mRNA and protein levels of synaptic-associated proteins decreased with reduced dendrite complexity and histone acetylation. Knockdown of pp32 rescued cognitive decline in cognitive-impaired aged mice with restoration of synaptic-associated proteins, the increase of spine density and elevation of histone acetylation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the aging-associated cognitive disturbance, indicating that suppression of pp32 might represent a promising therapeutic approach for learning and memory impairments.

In order to alleviate the computational difficulties in the evidence theory-based uncertainty quantification analysis, a combined strategy of differential evolution-based interval optimization method and parallel computing technique is proposed. A population-based multi-objective differential evolution optimization algorithm is designed for searching robust Pareto front. Two truss structures with shape and sizing optimum design problems are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.

Managing and extracting reliable information from such large series of data sets require the use of dedicated software organized in a consistent pipeline to reduce, validate, exploit, and ultimately export data. The compilation of multiple mass-spectrometry-based identification and quantification results obtained in the context of a large-scale project represents a real challenge for developers of bioinformatics solutions. In response to this challenge, we developed a dedicated software suite called hEIDI to manage and combine both identifications and semiquantitative data related to multiple LCMS/MS analyses. This paper describes how, through a user-friendly interface, hEIDI can be used to compile analyses and retrieve lists of nonredundant protein groups. Moreover, hEIDI allows direct comparison of series of analyses, on the basis of protein groups, while ensuring consistent protein inference and also computing spectral counts. hEIDI ensures that validated results are compliant with MIAPE guidelines as all information related to samples and results is stored in appropriate databases. Thanks to the database structure, validated results generated within hEIDI can be easily exported in the PRIDE XML format for subsequent publication. hEIDI can be downloaded from http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/docs/heidi.

The design considers multiple user acceptance criteria and functional requirements with the aim to facilitate robotic-assisted in-home rehabilitation therapy. Actuation modules containing shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, mechanical amplification and position sensors are designed to meet work requirements during activities of daily living. Modules containing differential configuration and spring bias configuration are built and presented. Kinematic and dynamic models are presented. A simplified material model which relates the system inputs to the SMA strain rate is derived and validated using open loop tracking results. This is combined with a gain scheduled servo-loop for disturbance rejection to create a feedforward controller. Mo dules and controller showed reasonable results tracking sinusoidal trajectories, with friction and controller parameters contributing to velocity instability. The theory of stiffness control in differential configuration and the requirement for control of the heating and cooling rates is presented. Miniature fans are fitted to control the cooling rate however this was unsuccessful probably due to the dominance of conduction heat transfer within the design. The modular actuators are tested while extracted from the exoskeleton design. The results lead to the conclusion that the following aspects require improvement before testing proceeds on a user: 1) integration of force sensors into the control loop, 2) hardware which improves the controlled cooling rate, 3) qualitative analysis of friction in the system.

634,"A well-known practice to accelerate construction projects is to overlap the design phase activities. For a typical construction project, a number of overlapping strategies exist during the design phase which all can result in timesaving. However, the cost of these strategies varies significantly depending on the total rework and complexity they generate. A favorable overlapping strategy is one that generates the required timesaving at the minimum cost. To find such a strategy, the question ""Which activities have to be overlapped and to what extent to reduce the project duration at the minimum cost?"" should be answered. This research aimed at answering the question through generating an overlapping optimization algorithm. The algorithm works based on the principles of genetic algorithms (GAs). The algorithm explained in the paper is unique compared to previous algorithms and frameworks available in the literature, as it can optimize multi-path networks and can handle all types of activity dependencies (i.e. finish-to-start, start-to-start, and finish-to-finish). It also takes both critical and non-critical activities into account and follows the critical path if the critical path changes or new critical paths emerge. A computer tool was also developed to run, examine and validate the overlapping optimization algorithm. This paper introduces the algorithm and the computer tool in detail and explains the results of their validation through optimizing a real-world project schedule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) fractions showed an abnormal fast moving Hb component. We aimed to determine if this variant was the cause of polycythemia in this patient. A complete blood count (CBC) was performed by an automated cell counter and Hb fractions were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Standard stability tests and oxygen affinity evaluation were also performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the phenol chloroform method and the entire -globin gene was analyzed by direct sequencing. At the hematological level, no anemia or hemolysis was observed but an abnormal Hb fraction was detected using cation exchange HPLC. Molecular analysis of the -globin gene showed heterozygosity for an AAG>ACG substitution at codon 144, resulting in a LysThr amino acid replacement. We demonstrated that this is a new Hb variant with increased oxygen affinity. Its altered physiology is caused by the reduction of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) effects, due to an amino acid substitution in the central pocket near the C-terminal of the chain. We called this new variant Hb San Cataldo for the native city of proband.

Radio spikes have time scales of 20-200 ms, while hard X-ray bursts rarely show fine structures shorter than 1 s. The main conclusions of a statistical analysis of a) the association rate, b) the correlation degree, and c) relative time delays between hard X-ray and radio spike emissions, are: 1) Radio spike bursts reveal the highest hard X-ray association rate of any kind of coherent solar radio emission; approximately 95% of the observed events occur during (mostly impulsive) hard X-ray bursts. Conversely, almost-equal-to 2% of all HXRBS flares produce radio millisecond spike bursts. 2) Spike bursts are preferentially associated with the impulsive phase of the hard X-ray event; about half of all observations are closely associated with the main peak of a simultaneous X-ray event. 3) We find a significant temporal correlation between spike clusters and hard X-ray events. About 43% of the compared events show hard X-ray time profiles that mimic the concentration of simultaneous radio spikes. This also holds for small fluctuations with time scales of the order of a few seconds. 4) The durations of spike events and associated hard X-ray bursts closely correlate, the X-ray bursts being somewhat longer than the radio events. 5) The radio emission is usually delayed in respect to hard X-ray bursts, typically a few seconds. The relative delays seem to be restricted to the following rules: The radio event usually starts before the peak time of the hard X-ray event (73 out of 84 cases), and similarly, the X-ray burst almost always starts before the maximum of spike burst activity (83 out of 84 cases). This is shown to hold for a wide range of burst durations. We have not found any convincing relation concerning the relative time differences of the end times, however. 6) The observed delays of the order of several seconds put some constraints on the acceleration and propagation of particles. The delays are found to be incompatible with the build-up time of a loss-cone distribution (for maser emission) by an order of magnitude, if the, same population of electrons is responsible for radio and X-ray radiation. Rather, considering the smallness of the radio spike sources, the proportionality of the X-ray flux with the spike rate, and the spatial 'spread of a propagating electron population, it is argued that both the time delays and the quantization into discrete radio events are caused by the operation of the accelerator.

In spite of the high energy content in organic waste materials, they have been mostly disposed of in landfills, which causes harmful environmental issues such as methane emissions and ground water pollution and contaminations. In this sense, organic solid waste materials are regarded as alternative resources for conversion to useful energy in the steam gasification process. In this study, three types of waste materials - municipal solid waste (MSW), used tires and sewage sludge - were used to generate syngas through the gasification process in a 1000 degrees C steam atmosphere. The syngas generation rates and its chemical compositions were measured and evaluated over time to determine the characteristics and dynamics of the gasification process. Also, carbon conversion, and mass and energy balances are presented which demonstrates the feasibility of steam gasification as a waste conversion pathway. The results show that the syngas contains high concentrations of H-2, around 41-55% by volume. The syngas generation rate was found to depend on the carbon content in the feedstock regardless of the types of input materials. Comparing to the hydrogen production from water splitting that requires extremely high temperatures at around 1500 degrees C, hydrogen production by steam gasification of organic materials can be regarded as equally effective but requires lower system temperatures.

In this study, we found no significant differences in short-term functional recovery between femoral neck fracture patients who received bisphosphonate treatment at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Introduction Bisphosphonate is the mainstay therapy for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate initiation on short-term functional recovery in femoral neck fracture patients at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Methods One hundred patients were randomly allocated into two groups in a parallel group designed, randomized, controlled trial. Both groups received risedronate 35 mg/week at either 2 or 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. All patients received calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Functional recovery was assessed by de Morton Mobility Index, Barthel Index, EuroQol 5D, visual analog scale, 2-min walk test, and timed get-up-and-go test at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Results At the 3-month follow-up, all functional outcome measures showed significant improvement in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the functional outcomes between groups at both the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. Although patients who received bisphosphonate initiation at week 2 had lower serum calcium level at 3 months and more overall adverse events than patients in the week 12 group, no patients in either group discontinued their prescribed medications. Conclusions While underpowered, the findings of this study suggest that there were no significant differences in short-term functional recovery or significant adverse events between the two bisphosphonate groups. Thus, the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy may be considered as early as 2 weeks after femoral neck fracture. It is important that low serum calcium and vitamin D status must be corrected with calcium and vitamin D supplementation prior to or at the time of bisphosphonate initiation. Clinical trial registration number This study was registered in the database via the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) (NCT02148848).

Prenatally stressed offspring rats were used to investigate the potential antidepressive-like effects of imperatorin (IMP) extracted from the root of radix angelica. After 4 weeks of treatment of IMP, behavioral tests (sucrose-preference test, forced-swimming test, and open-field test) were measured. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serotonin transporters (5-HTT) and 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) mRNA expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were also determined by real-time PCR. Administration with IMP (15 and 30 mg/kg/day, intragastrically) for 28 days markedly increased the percentage of sucrose (anhedonia), decreased the immobility time, and increased the number of total crossings, center crossings, rearing, and grooming in the male prenatally stressed offspring. Meanwhile, we found that 5-HT concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was significantly increased in the IMP-treated group. Subsequently, we found significantly decreased 5-HTT and increased 5-HT1AR mRNA expressions in the hippocampus and frontal cortex after IMP treatment in the prenatally stressed male offspring. IMP showed antidepressive-like effects and increased 5-HT concentration in male prenatally stressed offspring, suggesting that IMP could be of therapeutic use in preventing depressive-like behavior in adolescence.

645,"Accurate condition assessment of in-service infrastructure systems is critical for system-wide prioritization decisions. Current protocols require lengthy inspections and expensive equipment to examine large infrastructure systems. Furthermore, changes in inspection protocols over time can create discontinuities in recording and understanding the time history of a structure. To address these challenges, a systematic and adaptive technique for converting two-dimensional (2D) digital images into three-dimensional (3D) models has been developed, with the goal of creating high-resolution and scale-accurate inspection records. The developed reconstruction technique utilizes multiscale imaging to reconstruct a structure with varying levels of details and geometric complexity. The captured images are then converted into photorealistic, accurate, and dense 3D scene reconstructions by utilizing a hierarchical adaptation of a dense structure-from-motion (DSfM) algorithm. The result of this approach is a virtual 3D model of the structure with accurate geometry and high-fidelity representation of fine details. The accuracy, completeness, adaptability, and feasibility of the developed method were compared to both terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and conventional DSfM methods. Experimental findings and direct comparison between generated point clouds indicate that the developed hierarchical technique consistently produces dense point clouds capable of resolving 0.1-mm details, an order of magnitude improvement over existing methods. The developed technique also allows for user-controlled point cloud density, a significant benefit over current reconstruction methods. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

646,"A new solution for an ultra-low-voltage, low-power, bulk-driven operational amplifier is presented in the paper. The amplifier is based on a new input stage, exploiting the concept of partial positive feedback. As compared with prior work, the proposed input stage offers improvement of all basic performance metrics, including such important parameters as input-referred noise and offset voltage. In order to improve the DC voltage gain of the overall op-amp, a novel solution for an ultra-low-voltage, high-input-resistance common-mode amplifier has also been proposed. Simulated performance of the overall operational amplifier for a 50 nm CMOS process and supply voltage of 0.4 V shows power dissipation of 24 W, the open-loop voltage gain of 60dB, and the gain-bandwidth product of 2.18 MHz for 20 pF load capacitance.

648,"Although there is a strong focus on NoSQL databases for cloud computing environments, traditional relational data bases are still an integral part of many computing services in the cloud. Two significant issues in managing a relational database in a cloud environment are handling the inevitable evolution of the database schema and managing changes to system configuration and other data stored in the database as the system evolves over time. Techniques for handling these issues in on-premise databases are much less feasible in cloud computing environments, which demand efficiency, elasticity, and scalability. We propose a versioning system that can be used in relational databases to allow new versions of the database schema and data to be maintained within the same database as the production data. Past research on versioning either handles data versioning but not schema changes, or handles both but is focused on OLAP or XML databases. In this paper, we describe a mechanism for storing concurrent versions of data in an OLTP database. We explore two different implementation alternatives for versioned data storage and evaluate their relative merits given different workloads. We provide a concrete description of how this can be implemented within the InnoDB storage engine, which is the default data store for MySQL databases, and we present a quantitative comparison of the two implementations in InnoDB.

649,"African Americans suffer disproportionately from smoking-related morbidity and mortality and make more quit attempts but report less success in quitting. Smokers tend to identify more strongly with African American culture. Qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit perceptions toward smoking and intervention content. Seventy-one African American smokers recruited from community locations participated. The majority stated they would not use any cessation aids if trying to quit smoking, despite the availability of free nicotine replacement. Acculturative stress scores were significantly higher in younger participants and those with higher income. Higher African American acculturation did not predict smoking cessation intervention preference. Family and social relationships were cited as both reasons for wanting to quit and reasons for continuing to smoke. Based on these findings, interventions for urban African Americans should address household members continuing to smoke, social/family connections, stress management, and cultural identification in urban areas.

650,"Algorithmic music composition is concerned with generation of music through algorithms. Using natural language text as the basis for generation opens up interesting ideas for research. We have identified three strategies for mapping text to music: using all the letters, using only vowels and using vowels in conjunction with the word's part of speech (POS). The third approach is best achieved with a full parse tree since it helps in identifying the most probable POS tag. Using text input and applying these strategies, we derive a sequence of notes (pitches) as well as the rhythm (note durations). Punctuation symbols in the input text are mapped to Rest. To achieve greater flexibility with the composition, instead of directly mapping to concrete notes, we use relativized note indices and combine these with Scale, Key and Octave parameters to determine the actual note. Our music composition library is implemented in Wolfram's Mathematica, a popular symbolic computation environment. For parsing the input text we use J/Link to make call-outs to Apache OpenNLP library. In this paper, we describe our strategies in detail and suggest possible areas for future work.

651,"Ambient Intelligence has emerged lately as the integrating concept which includes Ubiquitous Computing, Ubiquitous Communication and Intelligent User Interfaces. The real implementation of such concepts is based on the use of new technology and innovative ways of development. Agent Oriented Software Engineering techniques and concepts have been used as a way of providing support to ubiquitous computing and communication. In addition, intelligent user interfaces require systems that provide a more efficient and rich interface with the user than the traditional ones. This paper presents a platform called MAPAS, which uses Ambient Intelligence concepts and techniques to give a fully scalable solution to a particular problem. The chosen system provides a solution, using the platform, to personalize the dissemination of events, that is, the system makes available to the user a set of events of his/her interest. This kind of systems requires a high degree of user's personalization. However nowadays, it is the user who must search the events of interest or subscribe to several different services or pages. The platform introduced in this paper takes profit of Agent Oriented technology to provide a system composed of various agents who may run in different devices, which communicate and provide a user personalized selection of events. Moreover, the system is aware of the surrounding environment, can be installed on smart devices, provides a rich and intuitive user interface and uses Augmented Reality techniques to give spatial location data about the events. Regarding the characteristics of the solution, it seems to be suitable for problems in the domain of Ambient Intelligence.

The statistics of electricity demand are assumed to be known and propagated through a linearized model of the equations describing the power flow balance at each node of the network. The proposed algorithm incorporates the transient dynamics of the power system following a line outage and is applied to the measurements of voltage phase angles, which are collected using phasor measurement units. This adaptive algorithm is developed by treating the QCD problem as a dynamic composite hypothesis testing problem. It is shown to have superior performance compared with other line outage detection algorithms previously proposed in the literature. Case studies demonstrating this gain in performance are illustrated through the IEEE 118-bus test system.

654,"AIM To assess the impact of underlying liver disease etiology on the presenting features and outcomes in a large cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS A prospective database of all patients with HCC was established from 1998 to March 2012. One thousand and seventy-eight patients were categorized into three groups, based on the etiology of their liver disease: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and non-viral liver disease (NVLD). Overall survival was determined by Kaplan Meier analysis to time of death or last follow-up. RESULTS HCC patients with HCV (85%) were more likely to be diagnosed as part of a surveillance program, compared to HBV or NVLD (both 71%) (p < 0.001). Patients with NVLD were more likely to receive best supportive care (29%) compared to those with HBV (21%) or HCV (20%) (p < 0.02). Twelve percent of NVLD and 13% of HBV patients underwent liver transplantation compared to 21% of HCV patients (p = 0.001). Median survival from presentation was lowest in NVLD (1.7 years) when compared to HBV (2.8 years) and HCV (2.6 years) (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival included Child Turcotte Pugh score, size of dominant lesion, absence of vascular invasion, and management with surgical resection or liver transplantation. Patient age and the etiology of the underlying liver disease were not independent predictors of survival CONCLUSION Patients with NVLD and HCC were less likely to be enrolled in a HCC surveillance program and are less likely to have curative therapies such as liver resection and transplantation after diagnosis with HCC, when compared to patients with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.

663,"A global map of drought risk has been elaborated at the sub-national administrative level. The motivation for this study is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions, population groups and economic sectors. Drought risk is assessed for the period 20002014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Drought hazard is derived from a non-parametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 0.5; drought exposure is based on a non-parametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities, crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social, economic and infrastructural indicators, collected at both the national and sub-national levels. The performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature. Our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure, while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values. Drought risk is lower for remote regions, such as tundras and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming, such as South-Central Asia, Southeast of South America, Central Europe and Southeast of the United States. As climate change projections foresee an increase of drought frequency and intensity for these regions, then there is an aggravated risk for global food security and potential for civil conflict in the medium- to long-term. Since most agricultural regions show high infrastructural vulnerability to drought, then regional adaptation to climate change may begin through implementing and fostering the widespread use of irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems. In this context, reduction in drought risk may also benefit from diversifying regional economies on different sectors of activity and reducing the dependence of their GDP on agriculture.

Here, we introduce CellFIT-3D, a force inference technique that allows tension maps for three-dimensional cellular systems to be estimated from image stacks. Like its predecessors, video force microscopy and CellFIT, this cell mechanics technique assumes boundary-specific interfacial tensions to be the primary drivers, and it constructs force-balance equations based on triple junction (TJ) dihedral angles. The technique involves image processing, segmenting of cells, grouping of cell outlines, calculation of dihedral planes, averaging along three-dimensional TJs, and matrix equation assembly and solution. The equations tend to be strongly overdetermined, allowing indistinct TJs to be ignored and solution error estimates to be determined. Application to clean and noisy synthetic data generated using Surface Evolver gave tension errors of 1.6-7%, and analyses of eight-cell murine embryos gave estimated errors smaller than the 10% uncertainty of companion aspiration experiments. Other possible areas of application include morphogenesis, cancer metastasis and tissue engineering.

The lateral shape of these 2D materials is typically considered random and irregular, and their average size is often estimated using techniques characterized by strong approximations or poor statistical significance. Here we measure in a quantitative, objective way the size and shape of 2D monoatomic nanosheets using a combination of optical, electronic and scanning probe techniques. We measure, one by one, the size and shape of thousands of sheets of graphene oxide as they undergo a standard ultrasonication treatment. Using automatic image processing and statistical modelling we identify two different fragmentation processes in 2D at the nanoscale, related to two populations of nanosheets described by gamma and exponential size distributions respectively. The two populations of sheets coexist during the fragmentation process, each one retaining its average size and shape. Our results explain the size reduction commonly observed in nanosheets upon sonication as an effect of changes in the respective weights of the two populations of nanosheets present in the material.

668,"A In this paper, a robust control approach is used to address the problem of adaptive behavioral treatment design. Human behavior (e.g., smoking and exercise) and reactions to treatment are complex and depend on many unmeasurable external stimuli, some of which are unknown. Thus, it is crucial to model human behavior over many subject responses. We propose a simple (low order) uncertain affine model subject to uncertainties whose response covers the most probable behavioral responses. The proposed model contains two different types of uncertainties: uncertainty of the dynamics and external perturbations that patients face in their daily life. Once the uncertain model is defined, we demonstrate how least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) can be used as an identification tool. The lasso algorithm provides a way to directly estimate a model subject to sparse perturbations. With this estimated model, a robust control algorithm is developed, where one relies on the special structure of the uncertainty to develop efficient optimization algorithms. This paper concludes by using the proposed algorithm in a numerical experiment that simulates treatment for the urge to smoke.

However, all fertilizer must be applied in a single basal dose before the soil surface is covered by plastic film in GCRPS resulting in excessive vegetative crop growth and nitrogen deficiency during the reproductive stage. Furthermore, a severe drawback of GCRPS is soil and water pollution from residuals polyethylene film used for ground cover. A two-year field experiment was conducted using biodegradable film together with treatments comparing all basal application of N with application of N as three splits and a single basal fertilization of urea plus manure. We examined N uptake and crop growth from transplanting harvest, rice grain yield, yield components, dynamics of tillers and shoot dry matter, and N recovery efficiency. Compared to basal application of all N fertilizer in GCRPS, split application of N or a basal combination of urea plus manure in conjunction with the use of biodegradable film 1) significantly increased rice grain yield, number of productive tillers, and spikelets per square meter; 2) improved crop growth rate and N uptake rate from panicle initiation to maturity; and 3) significantly increased agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer and recovery efficiency of N in grains.

670,"A crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference data bases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as to unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (800-130000 species) and variation in the completeness of the reference data bases (representing 15-100% of known species). Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased probabilities of taxonomic placement, which means its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels. We conclude that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging and that neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference. A key aim for future research is the completion of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases and making these two types of data compatible.

The approach is based on alternating two steps: Clustering-Evolutionary game. The clustering step is performed by an algorithm that takes into account the energy constraint in election of cluster-heads. The interactions between each pair of cluster-heads, when exchanging data, in their contribution to the security of the network, are modeled as an evolutionary game which is the second step of the proposed approach.

This report describes novel molecular and clinical analyses of PER3 VNTR polymorphisms to better define their functional consequences. As the PER3 VNTR is located in the exonic (protein coding) region of PER3, we initially investigated whether both alleles (variants) are transcribed into messenger RNA in human fibroblasts. The VNTR showed bi-allelic gene expression. We next investigated genetic associations in relation to clinical variables in 274 older adult Caucasian individuals. Independent variables included genotypes for the PER3 VNTR as well as a representative set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that tag common variants at the PER3 locus (linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic variants < 0.5). In order to comprehensively evaluate variables analyzed individually in prior analyses, dependent measures included PSG total sleep time and sleep latency, self-rated chronotype, estimated with the Composite Scale (CS), and lifestyle regularity, estimated using the social rhythm metric (SRM). Initially, genetic polymorphisms were individually analyzed in relation to each outcome variable using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Nominally significant associations were further tested using regression analyses that incorporated individual ANOVA-associated DNA variants as potential predictors and each of the selected sleep/circadian variables as outcomes. The covariates included age, gender, body mass index and an index of medical co-morbidity. Significant genetic associations with the VNTR were not detected with the sleep or circadian variables. Nominally significant associations were detected between SNP rs1012477 and CS scores (p = 0.003) and between rs10462021 and SRM (p = 0.047); rs11579477 and average delta power (p = 0.043) (analyses uncorrected for multiple comparisons). In conclusion, alleles of the VNTR are expressed at the transcript level and may have a functional effect in cells expressing the PER3 gene. PER3 polymorphisms had a modest impact on selected sleep/circadian variables in our sample, suggesting that PER3 is associated with sleep and circadian function beyond VNTR polymorphisms. Further replicate analyses in larger, independent samples are recommended.

675,"A diversity of synthetic cathinones has flooded the recreational drug marketplace worldwide. This variety is often a response to legal control actions for one specific compound (e.g. methcathinone) which has resulted in the emergence of closely related replacement. Based on recent trends, the nitrogen atom is one of the sites in the cathinone molecule being explored by designer type modifications. In this study, we designed and synthesized two new synthetic cathinones, (1) alpha-piperidinopropiophenone (PIPP) and (2) alpha-piperidinopentiothiophenone (PIVT), which have piperidine ring substituent on their nitrogen atom. Thereafter, we evaluated whether these two compounds have an abuse potential through the conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice and self-administration (SA) in rats. We also investigated whether the substances can induce locomotor sensitization in mice following 7 days daily injection and challenge. qRT-PCR analyses were conducted to determine their effects on dopamine-related genes in the striatum. PIPP (10 and 30 mg/kg) induced CPP in mice, but not PIVT. However, both synthetic cathinones were not self-administered by the rats and did not induce locomotor sensitization in mice. qRT-PCR analyses showed that PIPP, but not PIVT, reduced dopamine transporter gene expression in the striatum. These data indicate that PIPP, but not PIVT, has rewarding effects, which may be attributed to its ability to affect dopamine transporter gene expression. Altogether, this study suggests that PIPP may have abuse potential. Careful monitoring of this type of cathinone and related drugs are advocated.

676,"A non-contact type force actuator is necessary for studying the dynamic performance of a high-speed spindle system owing to its high-speed operating conditions. A non-contact electromagnetic exciter is designed for identifying the dynamic coefficients of journal bearings in high-speed grinding spindles. A linear force control method is developed based on PID controller. The influence of amplitude and frequency of current, misalignment and rotational speed on magnetic field and excitation force is investigated based on two-dimensional finite element analysis. The electromagnetic excitation force is measured with the auxiliary coils and calibrated by load cells. The design is validated by the experimental results. Theoretical and experimental investigations show that the proposed design can accurately generate linear excitation force with sufficiently large amplitude and higher signal to noise ratio. Moreover, the fluctuations in force amplitude are reduced to a greater extent with the designed linear control method even when the air gap changes due to the rotor vibration at high-speed conditions. Besides, it is possible to apply various types of excitations: constant, synchronous, and non-synchronous excitation forces based on the proposed linear control method. This exciter can be used as linear-force exciting and controlling system for dynamic performance study of different high-speed rotor-bearing systems.

677,"A method for analyzing the coupled wind-vehicle-bridge system is proposed that also considers the shielding effect of the bridge tower with triangular wind barriers. The static wind load and the buffeting wind load for both the bridge and the vehicle are included. The shielding effects of the bridge tower and the triangular wind barriers are incorporated by taking the surface integral of the wind load. The inter-history iteration is adopted to solve the vehicle-bridge dynamic equations with time-varying external loads. The results show that after installing the triangular wind barriers in the area of the bridge tower, the bridge response and the vehicle safety factors change slightly. The peak value of the train car body acceleration is significantly reduced when the wind barrier size is increased.

678,"An indirect type forced convection solar dryer using Phase Change Material (PCM) was designed, constructed and experimentally investigated. The dryer consists of a solar air panel for a direct heating of the drying agent, a solar energy accumulator (solar air collector with PCM cavity) and a drying chamber. The solar dryer was tested under no load with and without PCM. The present study is aimed at investigating the feasibility of using a solar air heater with PCM to store the solar energy during the daytime, and to release it during the night. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the charging and the discharging characteristics of the latent storage unit (PCM cavity). The daily energy efficiency of the solar energy accumulator reached 33.9%, while the daily exergy efficiency reached 8.5%. The results show that after using the solar energy accumulator, the temperature of the drying chamber is higher than the ambient temperature by 4-16 degrees C, all the night. In addition, the relative humidity in the drying chamber was observed 17-34.5% lower than the ambient relative humidity, in the case of the solar dyer with PCM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

679,"An important factor that governs solar energy transformation into electrical or chemical energy, when using nanoparticles-based devices, is the spatial location of traps limiting electron transport. Evidences have been presented indicating that the electron diffusion is strongly influenced by nanoparticle boundaries, whose characteristics depend on the particles preparation. In the present work we have studied the role of hydrated excess proton structures in the formation of anatase nanoparticles boundaries in samples prepared by TiCl4 hydrolysis at low temperature and strong acidic conditions. The samples, constituted by anatase nanocrystals but, mainly, by amorphous titania, are studied by H-1-MAS NMR, FT-IR and HRTEM. The results indicate that hydrated excess proton species, generated by solvation of bridging hydroxyls protons of highly defective anatase and/or amorphous titania chains, favor the chains bonding to anatase nanoparticles and/or their condensation at the nanoparticles surface. The chains' bonding facilitates the anatase particles aggregation producing oriented self-assemblings. The preparation conditions determine a strong condensation of amorphous titania chains and it should favor anatase transformation into rutile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this randomized, single-blinded, exploratory study was to evaluate the counter-irritation effects of cold-stimulation and topical application of transient receptor potential TRPA1/M8-agonists (trans-cinnamaldehyde/Lmenthol, respectively), on histamine-induced itch, wheals and neurogenic inflammation in 13 healthy volunteers. Histamine 1% was applied to the volar forearms using skin prick-test lancets. Recorded outcome-parameters were itch intensity, wheal reactions, and neurogenic inflammation (measured by laser-speckle perfusion-imaging). Homotopic thermal counter-irritation was performed with 6 temperatures, ranging from 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C, using a 3 x 3-cm thermal stimulator. Chemical ""cold-like"" counter-irritation was conducted with 40% L-men-thol and 10% trans-cinnamaldehyde, while 5% doxepin was used as a positive antipruritic control/comparator. Cold counter-irritation stimuli from 4 degrees C to 22 degrees C inhibited itch in a stimulus-intensitydependent manner (p < 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, also wheal reactions and neurogenic inflammation. Chemical ""cold-like"" counter-irritation with both Lmenthol and trans-cinnamaldehyde had antipruritic efficacy similar to doxepin (p < 0.05). Cold-induced counter-irritation had an inhibitory effect on histaminergic itch, suggesting that agonists of cold transduction receptors could be of potential antipruritic value.

681,"Accumulation of brain iron has been suggested as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Increased iron has been seen in the cerebral cortex in postmortem studies of neurodegenerative diseases and healthy aging. Until recently, the diminutive thickness of the cortex and its relatively low iron content have hampered in vivo study of cortical iron accumulation. Using phase images of a T2*-weighted sequence at ultrahigh field strength (7 Tesla), we examined the iron content of 22 cortical regions in 70 healthy subjects aged 22e80 years. The cortex was automatically segmented and parcellated, and phase shift was analyzed using an in-house developed method. We found a significant increase in phase shift with age in 20 of 22 cortical regions, concurrent with current understanding of cortical iron accumulation. Our findings suggest that increased cortical iron content can be assessed in healthy aging in vivo. The high spatial resolution and sensitivity to iron of our method make it a potentially useful tool for studying cortical iron accumulation in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

The adverse effects of dipyridamole and other stress agents have been evaluated. The aim of this research is to confirm the dynamic data on dipyridamole side effects during MPS. Methods: We collected data of 183 patients who underwent dipyridamole-induced stress MPS by retrospectively reviewing their clinical records, which included the severity of dipyridamole side effects in 3 min, 10 min, and 20 min after infusion. The incidence and severity at all three points, including the effect of age and gender, were obtained. Results: Adverse effects occurred in 96 patients (69.6%). The most frequent symptoms were dizziness (42.8%), chest tightness (24.6%), abdominal pain (18.1%), and headache (15.2%). Most symptoms were Grade 1 to 2, according to the grading system for common terminology criteria. The median duration of symptom persistence was 36 min, not significantly different among age and gender. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the adverse effects of dipyridamole were generally minimal and its duration was acceptable for clinical usage. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

The generalized extreme value distribution is extended to incorporate the time-dependence using a state space representation where the state variables either follow an autoregressive (AR) process or a moving average (MA) process with innovations arising from a Gumbel distribution. Using a Bayesian approach, an efficient algorithm is proposed to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo method where we exploit an accurate approximation of the Gumbel distribution by a ten-component mixture of normal distributions. The methodology is illustrated using extreme returns of daily stock data.

Variants in PIK3CD, which encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta isoform, enhance membrane association and kinase activity, resulting in increased signal transduction through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic PIK3CD variant in a patient with history of immunologic impairment, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and lymphoid hyperplasia presenting as intussusception.

In spite of the rise of NoSQL technologies, the development of new information systems is still mostly based on relational databases. Given the increasing awareness about the benefits of data analysis as well as current research interest in graph mining techniques, we aim to enable the usage of those techniques on relational data. In that regard, we propose a universal relational-to-graph data conversion algorithm which can be used in preparation of data to perform a graph mining analysis. Our approach leverages the property graph model which is mainly used by the graph databases, while maintaining the level of relational data clarity.

Here, gene expression profile changed between the human fetal and adult heart was characterized. A human microarray was applied to define the gene expression signatures of the fetal (13-17 weeks of gestation, n = 4) and adult hearts (30-40 years old, n = 4). Gene ontology analyses, pathway analyses, gene set enrichment analyses, and signal transduction network were performed to predict the function of the differentially expressed genes. Ten mRNAs were confirmed by quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction. 5547 mRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed.

689,"A compact add-on model is proposed to simulate the mechanism of charge trapping and release (detrapping) and its effect on the threshold voltage of MOSFET devices. The model uses implicit algebraic differential equations compatible with transient analysis in SPICE. It also shares the accuracy level of the transient analysis. A micro model approach is used, and each trap is treated by a two-state Markov process. The normalization of trap behavior can be enabled or disabled, so that the designer can compare average trap behavior to the result of repeated Monte-Carlo simulations of a circuit. In this manner, the model can compromise between device-level modeling and circuit-level modeling. Unlike models geared towards digital circuit design, the trapping and release rates need not be constant during electrical stress. The trapping and release rates are a function of time, as they depend on the circuit state-space equations. An operational amplifier is analyzed using the new model, and the proposed approach is compared with the state of the art. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts. 2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened. 3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable. 4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use. 5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

Lean construction emphasizes the concept of flow as a way to understand production in construction, yet there is still no accepted metric for measurement of flow quality. This has hampered research and practice. The proposed construction flow index (CFI) is a composite measure that reflects the quality of production flow in repetitive construction projects. It incorporates measures of work continuity for crews, processing continuity for locations, production rate variation, amounts of work in progress, interference and operation sequence logic. Expert knowledge was acquired to establish weights for the CFI parameters, and its use was tested in evaluating the planned and actual production flows for a number of projects. Project managers can use the CFI to evaluate the quality of their construction plans and to measure and communicate production flow quality status to trade crews, enabling management and improvement of production flow. The CFI is also a valuable tool for construction research. The CFI challenges traditional construction management by measuring flow, where standard practice only measures transformation (earned value). It challenges lean construction practice using the Last Planner System, suggesting that the percent plan complete measure of plan reliability is insufficient.

To relate the diagnostic performance of [F-18]fluorocholine positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) to the phospholipid composition of liver tumors, radiopathologic correspondence was performed in patients with early-stage liver cancer who had undergone [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT before tumor resection. Tumor and adjacent liver were profiled by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, quantifying phosphatidylcholine species by mass-to-charge ratio. For clinical-radiopathologic correlation, HCC profiles were reduced to two orthogonal principal component factors (PCF1 and PCF2) accounting for 80 % of total profile variation. Tissues from 31 HCC patients and 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients were analyzed, revealing significantly higher levels of phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and highly saturated phosphatidylcholine species in HCC tumors relative to adjacent liver and ICC tumors. Significant loading values for PCF1 corresponded to phosphatidylcholines containing poly-unsaturated fatty acids while PCF2 corresponded only to highly saturated phosphatidylcholines. Only PCF2 correlated significantly with HCC tumor-to-liver [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio (rho = 0.59, p < 0.0005). Sensitivity for all tumors based on an abnormal [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio was 93 % while sensitivity for HCC based on increased tumor [F-18]fluorocholine uptake was 84 %, with lower levels of highly saturated phosphatidylcholines in tumors showing low [F-18]fluorocholine uptake. Most HCC tumors contain high levels of saturated phosphatidylcholines, supporting their dependence on de novo fatty acid metabolism for phospholipid membrane synthesis. While [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT can serve to identify these lipogenic tumors, its imperfect diagnostic sensitivity implies metabolic heterogeneity across HCC and a weaker lipogenic phenotype in some tumors.

Cardiomyocytes contraction can be quantified by measuring sarcomere length, but few tools are available for this, and none is freely distributed. We developed a plug-in (SarcOptiM) for the ImageJ/Fiji image analysis platform developed by the National Institutes of Health. SarcOptiM computes sarcomere length via fast Fourier transform analysis of video frames captured or displayed in ImageJ and thus is not tied to a dedicated video camera. It can work in real time or offline, the latter overcoming rotating motion or displacement-related artifacts. SarcOptiM includes a simulator and video generator of cardiomyocyte contraction. Acquisition parameters, such as pixel size and camera frame rate, were tested with both experimental recordings of rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and synthetic videos. It is freely distributed, and its source code is available. It works under Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems. The camera speed is the limiting factor, since the algorithm can compute online sarcomere shortening at frame rates >10 kHz. In conclusion, SarcOptiM is a free and validated user-friendly tool for studying cardiomyocyte contraction in all species, including human.

704,"1. INTRODUCTION The emergence of environmental problems as major social issues throughout the world has prompted sustainable development efforts in a wide range of areas, including industry, construction, and transportation, followed by the execution of numerous studies and policies. The concept of sustainable development has been dealt with in earnest in the construction field since the Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future at the 18th Chicago Convention of UIA in 1993. This Declaration included tasks to be implemented with respect to green buildings, such as the recycling of resources, application of energy-efficient designs, and utilization of natural energy in addition to the application of sustainable designs. As part of green building practices, countries around the world have been implementing various green building certification standards, such as LEED, GBCC, CASBEE, and BREEAM. These certification standards prescribe the criteria relating to the external environment, energy conservation, materials and resources, and the indoor environment, with energy conservation being the top priority for each of these issues. This is due to energy consumption in building operation accounting for more than half of the building life cycle cost. Accordingly, although many studies are undertaken for the purpose of developing the means for conserving energy in relation to green buildings, the majority of these studies are concentrated on the development of technologies for environmental facilities through the application of active designs. study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable? In other words, this study aims to elucidate the essence of sustainability in green building design implementation.

Only English-language websites were selected on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Researchers independently evaluated the quality of each website by using the DISCERN and the HONcode instruments. The readability levels were calculated using two formulas; the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, and the Coleman-Liau Readability Index. The agreement between the evaluators was calculated using Cohen kappa coefficient. RESULTS eighty-four websites were finally identified. Scores varied from a minimum DISCERN score of 18 to a maximum of 68 [mean +/- SD, 42.2 +/- 10.7; median = 41.5, interquartile range, interquartile range (IQR) = 15.8] and a minimum score of HONcode of 0.14 and a maximum of 0.95 (mean +/- SD, 0.16 +/- 0.19; median = 0.45, IQR = 0.29).

706,"Although a concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) column, which is one of the composite columns frequently used in building construction because of its structural performance, economic feasibility, and good space utilization, has a high potential to reduce CO2 emissions because of combining two heterogeneous materials, the relationship among CO2 emissions, cost, and structural parameters in green construction of buildings with CFT columns was not yet carried out. In this study, an optimum design model was proposed to analyze the relationship. Based on the analysis, it was founded that CFT with circular sections were more effective than square type in terms of CO2 emissions and cost by 57.03% and 11.18%, respectively, while square type was advantageous in aspect of space utilization than the circular section by 9.73%. Also, with the consideration of various strengths of materials, CO2 emissions, cost, and space utilization for the columns can be reduced by 24.38%, 29.66%, and 21.08%, respectively. In addition, the proposed model was applied to construction of a 35-story real building. From the analysis of optimum designs for the building, the circular section was more advantageous than square section regarding the CO2 emission and material cost by 2.47% and 8.57%, respectively, while square section occupied smaller space than circular section by 17.95%. It is concluded that CO2 emission, cost, and space utilization of the column in the real building can be reduced by 21.05%, 14.97%, and 20.18%, respectively, with the optimum section type and material strength.

707,"Among alternative scheduling techniques in construction management are linear and repetitive scheduling and line of balance (LOB). They are uniquely different from the dominant network-based technique because they have been developed for projects with repetitive units of work and crew operations. Notably, they feature quantitative measures of both work and time, which no network-based approach offers. However, a study of their origins - for example, the US Navy - reveals that their original use and capabilities deviate from current application, which is limited at best. Indeed, currently, the name-giving LOB is itself omitted. Therefore, this research has the goal to explore these scheduling techniques in detail. Its objectives are to delineate their modelling elements as described by original sources in a structured manner, to compare them in detail and identify any changes over time and to comment on implications for practical use and extract unsolved research questions. Its methodology follows a comparative research approach. Differences are found in how productivity and cyclic crew deployment are expressed, besides the glaring omission of the LOB itself in the construction use of this method. It is found that, historically, LOB was intended for manufacturing, but when introduced to construction, important characteristics of the production plan and progress chart became forgotten. In parallel, linear scheduling was developed for construction, whose similarities to LOB may have added confusion. Clarifying the complete methods by explicitly outlining their analytical capabilities will improve understanding to allow project managers to benefit from these powerful tools. It also enables future research to model LOB with singularity functions to yield a unified formulation of these alternative scheduling techniques.

708,"A high level of concern is placed on the storage, handling, transportation, and distribution of vaccines and other pharmaceutical products, particularly those that are time and temperature sensitive. While active and passive cooling equipment and monitoring devices are important, it is the various personnel responsible for executing and writing procedures, designing and operating systems, and investigating problems and helping prevent them who are paramount in establishing and maintaining a ""cold.chain"" for time and temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products (TTSPPs). These professionals must possess the required competencies, knowledge, skills and abilities so they can effectively perform these activities with appropriate levels of expertise. These are complex tasks that require the development of higher cognitive skills that cannot be adequately addressed through professional development opportunities based on simple information delivery and content acquisition. This paper describes two unique learning solutions (one on a bus called the ""wheels course"" and the other online called ""e-learning"") that have been developed by WHO Global Learning Opportunities (WHO/GLO) to provide participants with opportunities not just to learn about cold chain systems or vaccine management, but, rather, to develop high levels of expertise in their respective fields through experiential and authentic learning activities. In these interactive learning environments, participants have opportunities to address real-life situations in contexts similar to what they may face in their own work environments and develop solutions and critical thinking skills they can apply when they return to their jobs. This paper further delineates the managerial and operational vaccine management functions encompassed in these two unique learning environments. The paper also describes the alignment of the objectives addressed in the ""wheels course"" and the e-learning version with effective vaccine management (EVM) criteria as prescribed by WHO. The paper concludes with an example of a real world product developed by course graduates (specifically a decision tree that is now used by some national programmes). These types of products, valuable in their own right, often emerge when learning environments based on authentic learning principles are designed and implemented as they were by WHO/GLO.

709,"Apple leaf disease is one of the main factors to constrain the apple production and quality. It takes a long time to detect the diseases by using the traditional diagnostic approach, thus farmers often miss the best time to prevent and treat the diseases. Apple leaf disease recognition based on leaf image is an essential research topic in the field of computer vision, where the key task is to find an effective way to represent the diseased leaf images. In this research, based on image processing techniques and pattern recognition methods, an apple leaf disease recognition method was proposed. A color transformation structure for the input RGB( Red, Green and Blue) image was designed firstly and then RGB model was converted to HSI( Hue, Saturation and Intensity), YUV and gray models. The background was removed based on a specific threshold value, and then the disease spot image was segmented with region growing algorithm( RGA). Thirty-eight classifying features of color, texture and shape were extracted from each spot image. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve the accuracy of the apple leaf disease identification, the most valuable features were selected by combining genetic algorithm( GA) and correlation based feature selection( CFS). Finally, the diseases were recognized by SVM classifier. In the proposed method, the selected feature subset was globally optimum. The experimental results of more than 90% correct identification rate on the apple diseased leaf image database which contains 90 disease images for there kinds of apple leaf diseases, powdery mildew, mosaic and rust, demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and effective.

710,"A method of chemistry tabulation combined with presumed probability density function (PDF) is applied to simulate piloted premixed jet burner flames with high Karlovitz number using large eddy simulation. Thermo-chemistry states are tabulated by the combination of auto-ignition and extended auto-ignition model. To evaluate the predictive capability of the proposed tabulation method to represent the thermo-chemistry states under the condition of different fresh gases temperature, a-priori study is conducted by performing idealised transient one-dimensional premixed flame simulations. Presumed PDF is used to involve the interaction of turbulence and flame with beta PDF to model the reaction progress variable distribution. Two presumed PDF models, Dirichlet distribution and independent beta distribution, respectively, are applied for representing the interaction between two mixture fractions that are associated with three inlet streams. Comparisons of statistical results show that two presumed PDF models for the two mixture fractions are both capable of predicting temperature and major species profiles, however, they are shown to have a significant effect on the predictions for intermediate species. An analysis of the thermo-chemical state-space representation of the sub-grid scale (SGS) combustion model is performed by comparing correlations between the carbon monoxide mass fraction and temperature. The SGS combustion model based on the proposed chemistry tabulation can reasonably capture the peak value and change trend of intermediate species. Aspects regarding model extensions to adequately predict the peak location of intermediate species are discussed.

Max NAE-SAT is given by a set U of boolean variables and a set C of clauses, and asks to find an assignment of U, such that the not-all-equal satisfied clauses of C are maximized. Max NAE-SAT turns into Max NAE-k-SAT if each clause contains just k literals. Max NAE-k-SAT for k = 2, 3 and 4 can be approximated to 1.139 (1/0.878), 1.10047 (1/0.9087) and 8/7 respectively. When k >= 5, little has been done in terms of algorithm design to approximate Max NAE-k-SAT. In this paper, we propose a local search algorithm which can approximate Max NAE-k-SAT to 2(k-1)/2(k-1) - 1 for k >= 2. Then we show that Max NAE-k-SAT can not be approximated within 2(k-1)/2(k-1) - 1 in polynomial time, if P not equal NP. Moreover, we extend the algorithm for Max NAE-k-SAT to approximate Max NAE-SAT where each clause contains at least k literals.

712,"Access control is critical for many applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) since the owner of an IoT device (and application) may only permit one user to access a subset of the resources of the device. To provide access control for an IoT network, recent work adopted the capability-based access control (CBAC) model, which allows an IoT device to decide on the authorization by itself based on a capability token. However, the existing approaches based on CBAC directly attach the capability token at the end of CoAP when sending a request message. For the receiver, it is not easy to retrieve the capability token from the request message if the CoAP payload is present, because CoAP does not have a length field to indicate the size of its payload. To counter this problem, we propose a CoAP option, Cap-Token, to encapsulate a capability token when sending request messages. Because a CoAP option is independent from other CoAP fields, a receiver can get the capability token from the Cap-Token option of the request message without ambiguity. We also provide a compression mechanism to reduce the size of the Cap- Token option. Our evaluation shows that the compression mechanism can save the size of the option by 60%. Adding a compressed Cap-Token option to a request message increases the IP datagram size by 45 bytes, which is only 41% of the increase when directly attaching the capability token at the end of CoAP.

In this study, data from the public Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey is used to compare the performance of green hospitals with the average performance of traditional hospitals. This study included 19 green hospitals and found that patients hospitalized in green facilities reported overall higher ratings than those in traditional hospitals when compared to the average performance of traditional hospitals of similar sizes and locations. Additionally, patients in green hospitals were more likely to recommend the hospital to their friends and family.

716,"85% of a construction worker's work-day is spent on the construction site. This means that a large part of a worker's health and wellbeing could depend on the construction site and its environs. Construction work, which is inherently stressful due to the ever present threat of fatalities and injuries, compromises the ergonomic reality and human sustenance on construction sites. This necessitates the need to create a beneficial and comfortable environment that is motivational, inspirational, and healing. The biophilic construction site model (BCSM) which involves methodology of 'greening construction sites', is proposed as a healthy means of tapping into the natural resources of the construction site environment. It is intended to create a comfort zone on the construction site that would generate a symbiotic benefit to enhance its humanistic value and engender the health and wellbeing and creative performance of workers. The paper reports on a case study in the form of a focus group study and a comparative analysis of two similar construction sites in the Northern Cape region of South Africa.

719,"Accessible summary What is known on the subject? The concept of compassion is well documented in the healthcare literature but has received limited attention in mental health nursing. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? Mental health nurses struggle with defining compassion. The study, with its limitations, brings greater clarity to the meaning of compassion for community mental health nurses and NHS organizations. Mental health nurses need time to reflect on their provision of compassionate care. What are the implications for practice? The study has shown that compassion is important for NHS healthcare management, frontline mental health nurses and policy-makers in UK, and there is potential for sharing practice and vision across NHS organisations. Mental health nurses could benefit from training to facilitate their understanding of compassionate practices. Emphasis should be placed on the importance of self-compassion and how this can be nurtured from the secure base of clinical supervision. Abstract Introduction There is increasing emphasis in policy, research and practice in the UK and internationally on the importance of caring in health care. Compassion needs to be at the core of all healthcare professionals' practice. Recently, health care has received negative attention through media and government reports which cite a lack of compassion in care. Rationale The concept of compassion has received limited attention in community mental health nursing. Aim Based on data taken from semi-structured interviews with community mental health nurses, this paper aims to describe interpretations and perspectives of compassion to gain insight and development of its meaning. Method A naturalistic, interpretive approach was taken to the study. Semi-structured interviews with nine mental health nurses were analysed using Burnard's 14-step model of thematic analysis. Findings The research illuminates the complexity of compassion and how its practice impacts on emotional responses and relationships with self, patients, colleagues and the employing organization. Participants identified difficulties engaging with compassionate practice whilst recognizing it as a driving force underpinning provision of care. Implications for practice Mental health nurses need to be supported to work towards a greater understanding of compassionate care for clinical practice and the need for self-compassion.

720,"Agent-based modelling and simulation is a promising methodology that can be applied in the study of population dynamics. The main advantage of this technique is that it allows representing the particularities of the individuals that are modeled along with the interactions that take place among them and their environment. Hence, classical numerical simulation approaches are less adequate for reproducing complex dynamics. Nowadays, there is a rise of interest on using distributed computing to perform large-scale simulation of social systems. However, the inherent complexity of this type of applications is challenging and requires the study of possible solutions from the parallel computing perspective (e.g., how to deal with fine grain or irregular workload). In this paper, we discuss the particularities of simulating populating dynamics by using parallel discrete event simulation methodologies. To illustrate our approach, we present a possible solution to make transparent the use of parallel simulation for modeling demographic systems: Yades tool. In Yades, modelers can easily define models that describe different demographic processes with a web user interface and transparently run them on any computer architecture environment thanks to its demographic simulation library and code generator. Therefore, transparency is provided by two means: the provision of a web user interface where modelers and policy makers can specify their agent-based models with the tools they are familiar with, and the automatic generation of the simulation code that can be executed in any platform (cluster or supercomputer). A study is conducted to evaluate the performance of our solution in a High Performance Computing environment. The main benefit of this outline is that our findings can be generalized to problems with similar characteristics to our demographic simulation model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The owners of these buildings often seek to identify and implement building upgrade measures that are capable of improving building sustainability as well as achieving certification under various green building rating systems such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). In order to support decision-makers in promoting building sustainability and achieving LEED certification for existing building, this paper presents the development of a novel optimization model that is capable of minimizing the required upgrade cost of achieving a desired LEED certification level such as Silver or Gold. The model is designed to identify cost-effective building measures, plans, and/or performance to achieve a specified LEED certification for existing buildings while keeping required upgrade cost to a minimum. The optimization model is implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA) due to its capabilities of identifying optimal solutions for this type of problem in a reasonable computational time, and efficiently and accurately modeling this specific optimization problem with the least number of decision variables and constraints. A project case study of a rest-area building is used to illustrate the optimization model and to demonstrate its novel and unique capabilities. The primary contribution this research makes to the body of knowledge is its new methodology for optimizing the selection of building upgrade measures to achieve LEED certification for existing building with minimum upgrade cost.

A heat dissipation model was put forward for evaluating the cooling efficiency by calculating the total thermal resistance in directional solidification. The total thermal resistance in the SSC method is the minimum compared with other methods.

The solidification time is reduced by 64.4%. The cooling rate increases dramatically as well. Additionally, the heat insulation of the hot and cool zones is improved substantially in the SSC method. The thermal resistance of the mould is reduced as well due to the thin mould. Besides, the SSC method employs the electrical network to control the growth rate.

730,"A broadband broad-angle radar cross-sectional (RCS) reduction measure applicable to planar surfaces is proposed. This novel structure contains several layers of randomly displaced metal patches and layers are spaced by a quarter wavelength. Specular reflection at normal incidence is suppressed by the phase cancellation technique. The reduction bandwidth is broadened by setting the layer surface area ratio based on binomial coefficients. Because the structure contains no absorbent material, metal surfaces are divided into small patches and displaced randomly to avoid reflection peaks beyond the boresight direction. The RCS reduction effect is validated via measurements in a far-field antenna range. Parametric studies and detailed discussions about this technique are conducted using simulation results computed from full-wave numerical tools, which include not only the specular reflection but also contributions from higher order scattering mechanisms. The proposed structure can be applied on planar target surfaces and has the potential to incorporate lossy dielectric loadings to reduce the structure thickness and suppress scatterings.

This is possible with the integration of excellent solvers to software engineering methodologies that provide optimization-based decision support for planning. Since the logistics market is growing rapidly, the optimization of routing systems is of primary concern that motivates the use of vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers as software components integrated as an optimization engine. A critical success factor of routing optimization is quality vs. response time performance. Less time-consuming and more efficient automated processes can be achieved by employing stronger solution algorithms. This study aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD) which is a popular extension of the basic Vehicle Routing Problem arising in real world applications where pickup and delivery operations are simultaneously taken into account to satisfy the vehicle capacity constraint with the objective of total travelled distance minimization. Since the problem is known to be NP-hard, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on an ant colony system (ACS) and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed for its solution. VNS is a powerful optimization algorithm that provides intensive local search. However, it lacks a memory structure. This weakness can be minimized by utilizing long term memory structure of ACS and hence the overall performance of the algorithm can be boosted. In the proposed algorithm, instead of ants, VNS releases pheromones on the edges while ants provide a perturbation mechanism for the integrated algorithm using the pheromone information in order to explore search space further and jump from local optima. The performance of the proposed ACS empowered VNS algorithm is studied on well-known benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature of VRPSPD for comparison purposes. Numerical results confirm that the developed approach is robust and very efficient in terms of both solution quality and CPU time since better results provided in a shorter time on benchmark data sets is a good performance indicator.

AmI environments can be diverse, such as homes, offices, meeting rooms, schools, hospitals, control centers, vehicles, tourist attractions, stores, sports facilities, and music devices. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a testbed for AmI using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian OS. We analyze the performance of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol in an indoor scenario. For evaluation we considered throughput, delay and jitter metrics.

737,"A Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) is a highly complex and unstable system. Designing a safe, reliable and robust controller with good performance for such a large and complex system is an important control engineering problem. In this work, a Decentralized Fuzzy Logic Controller (DFLC) with 140 input and 70 output membership functions, is designed for a 70th order Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) type PHWR. In order to obtain high performance of the controller, it needs to be tuned optimally, however, it is very challenging task to optimally tune the DFLC with such a large membership functions. Moreover, PHWR is a coupled system which imposes additional limitation in tuning the controller since the output of one PHWR's zone affects the outputs of other zones. In this work, an application of Nelder-Mead Algorithm (NMA) is presented for auto tuning the DFLC. The NMA performance depends upon objective function and initial points given to the NMA at the start of the tuning process. A novel method for selecting the optimal objective function and initial points for the NMA is also proposed since their selection is another complicated process. Although several objective functions have been proposed by the researchers for use with NMA, this work focuses five common indices (IAE, ISE, ITAE, ITSE and ISTE) as objective functions, which are simple and system independent. Finally, the optimally tuned high-performance DFLC is applied to the PHWR and evaluated by simulating different scenarios. The simulation results show that the controller is efficient, fast and robust and ensures the safety and reliability of the PHWR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

738,"A new sub-space max-monomial modeling scheme for CMOS transistors in sub-micron technologies is proposed to improve the modeling accuracy. Major electrical parameters of CMOS transistors in each sub-space from the design space are modeled with max-monomials. This approach is demonstrated to have a better accuracy for sub-micron technologies than singlespace models. Sub-space modeling based geometric programming power optimization has been successfully applied to three different op-amps in 0.18 mu m technology. HSPICE simulation results show that sub-space modeling based GP optimization can allow efficient and accurate analog design. Computational effort can be managed to an acceptable level when searching sub-spaces for transistors by using practical constraints. An efficient scheme in dealing with non-convex constraint inherent in Kirchhoff's voltage law is suggested in this paper. By using this scheme, the nonconvex constraint, such as posynomial equality, can be relaxed to a convex constraint without affecting the result.

739,"An enhanced version of a segmentation algorithm applied in X-ray images using a prior shape and a straightened boundary image (SBI) is proposed. In the SBI method, the boundary of the target object is extracted with a constant width along the prior shape and transformed to a rectangular image in which the edges are straightened. A new minimal path algorithm is proposed and applied to SBI minimising a cost function to select the best path corresponding to the edges of the target object. The cost function is calculated based on all possible paths from each pixel to the beginning of the image while lowering the computational complexity. Comparing with previous methods, the proposed method removes artefacts and provides clearer and smoother edges even when the prior shape is far from the target object. The method is also less sensitive to the initial positioning of the prior shape model.

740,"Aim Management of fistulating perianal Crohn's disease (fpCD) is a significant challenge for a colorectal surgeon. A recent survey of surgical practice in this condition showed variation in management approaches. As a result we set out to devise recommendations for practice for UK colorectal surgeons. Method Results from a national survey were used to devise a set of potential consensus statements. Consultant colorectal surgeons were invited to participate in the exercise via the previous survey and the mailing list of the professional society. Iterative voting was performed on each statement using a five-point Likert scale and electronic voting, with opportunity for discussion and refinement between each vote. Consensus was defined as >80% agreement. Results Seventeen surgeons and two patient representatives voted upon 51 statements. Consensus was achieved on 39 items. Participants advocated a patientcentred approach by a colorectal specialist, within strong multidisciplinary teamworking. The use of anti-TNF alpha therapy is advocated. Where definitive surgical techniques are considered they should be carefully selected to avoid adverse impact on function. Ano/rectovaginal fistulas should be managed by specialists in fistulating disease. Stoma or proctectomy could be discussed earlier in a patient's treatment pathway to improve choice, as they may improve quality of life. Conclusion This consensus provides principles and guidance for best practice in managing patients with fpCD.

741,"According to consciousness involvement, human's learning can be roughly classified into explicit learning and implicit learning. Contrasting strongly to explicit learning with clear targets and rules, such as our school study of mathematics, learning is implicit when we acquire new information without intending to do so. Research from psychology indicates that implicit learning is ubiquitous in our daily life. Moreover, implicit learning plays an important role in human visual perception. But in the past 60 years, most of the well-known machine-learning models aimed to simulate explicit learning while the work of modeling implicit learning was relatively limited, especially for computer vision applications. This article proposes a novel unsupervised computational model for implicit visual learning by exploring dissipative system, which provides a unifying macroscopic theory to connect biology with physics. We test the proposed Dissipative Implicit Learning Model (DILM) on various datasets. The experiments show that DILM not only provides a good match to human behavior but also improves the explicit machine-learning performance obviously on image classification tasks.

742,"Activation of the canonical wingless-related integration site (Wnt)/beta-catenin signaling pathway is associated with malignant transformation, development of fibrosis, and angiogenesis. We analyzed beta-catenin mRNA expression in bone marrow of 29 patients with primary (PMF), 4 with secondary (SMF) myelofibrosis, and 16 control participants using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). beta-Catenin expression is increased in PMF and SMF and might potentiate anemia. Introduction: beta-Catenin is a central effector molecule of the canonical wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling pathway. It is important for maintenance of stem cell homeostasis and its aberrant activation has been implicated in a wide array of malignant hematological disorders. There are few reports suggesting its dysregulation in Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Patients and Methods: We analyzed beta-catenin mRNA expression in bone marrow (BM) aspirates of 29 patients with primary (PMF) and 4 patients with secondary, post Ph- MPN, myelofibrosis (SMF) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). The control group consisted of 16 BM aspirates from patients with limited-stage aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma without BM involvement. We compared relative gene expression with clinical and hematological parameters. Results: Relative expression of A-catenin differed significantly among groups (P = .0002), it was significantly higher in patients with PMF and SMF than in the control group, but did not differ between patients with PMF and SMF. A negative correlation was found regarding hemoglobin level in PMF (P = .017). No association according to Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutational status or JAK2 V617F allele burden was detected. Conclusion: Our results show for the first time that beta-catenin mRNA expression is increased in patients with PMF and SMF and its upregulation might potentiate anemia. A number of inflammatory cytokines associated with PMF are capable of mediating their effects through increased beta-catenin expression. Accordingly, beta-catenin can induce expression of a number of genes implicated in processes of cell cycle control, fibrosis, and angiogenesis, which are central to the PMF pathogenesis. Therefore, beta-catenin might represent an interesting new therapeutic target in these diseases.

Given a digraph G, a partially complemented digraph (G) over tilde is a digraph obtained from G by performing a sequence of vertex complement operations on G. Dahlhaus et al. showed that, given an adjacency-list representation of (G) over tilde, depth-first search (DFS) on G can be performed in O(n + (m) over tilde) time, where (m) over tilde is the number of vertices and ill is the number of edges in (G) over tilde. This can be used for finding a depth-first spanning forest and the strongly connected components of the complement of G in time that is linear in the size of G, and Dahlhaus et al. give applications to finding the modular decomposition of an undirected graph that require that some adjacency lists be complemented and others not. To achieve this bound, their algorithm makes use of a somewhat complicated stack-like data structure to simulate the recursion stack, instead of implementing it directly as a recursive algorithm. We give a recursive O(n + (m) over tilde) algorithm that requires no such data-structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study considers the application of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology that can be applied to assess the sustainable development of transport infrastructure projects, taking into account a range of transport, social, financial and environmental criteria. Furthermore, in order to resolve the strategic decision making under resource constraints and the carbon footprint factor, a zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) model is developed to facilitate an optimal portfolio of sustainable public transport infrastructure projects in Taiwan. The resulting data shows that the perspective of sustaihable transport and the criterion of decreasing traffic energy consumption are the most significant evaluation factors, and that the Tamhai Light Rail (TLR) Project and Tambai Expressway (TE) Project comprise by far the optimal portfolio of sustainable transport infrastructure projects which strengthen the connection between activity-based costing (ABC) evaluation and carbon footprint in a life cycle assessment.

745,"Academic research and technological innovation associated with rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in the UK has seen a shift of emphasis in recent years. Traditional design approaches use whole life cost assessments that prioritise financial savings associated with the provision of an alternative water supply. However, researchers and practitioners are increasingly recognising broader benefits associated with rainwater reuse, such as stormwater attenuation benefits. This paper identifies and describes a set of novel RWH system configurations that have potential for deployment in UK houses. Conceptual schematics are provided to define these innovations alongside traditional configurations. Discussion of the drivers supporting these configurations illustrates the opportunities for RWH deployment in a wide range of settings. A quantitative multi criteria analysis was used to evaluate and score the configurations under a range of emerging criteria. The work identifies several RWH system configurations that can outperform traditional ones in terms of specified cost and benefits. Selection of a specific RWH technology is shown to be highly dependent on user priorities. It is proposed that the system configurations highlighted could enable RWH to be cost-effectively installed in a broad set of contexts that have experienced minimal exploitation to date.

748,"A new gain enhancement technique for an operational amplifier (opamp) using a replica amplifier is presented to reduce a sensitivity of a gain mismatch between the main amplifier and the replica amplifier which limits a gain-enhancement factor in the conventional replica-amp techniques. In the proposed technique, the replica amplifier is used to only amplify an error voltage of the main amplifier. The outputs of the main amplifier and the replica amplifier are added to cancel the error voltage of the main amplifier. The proposed technique can also achieve a higher output voltage swing because the replica amplifier amplifies only the error voltage. In case of using a fully-differential common-source opamp for the main amplifier and a telescopic opamp for the replica amplifier, Monte Carlo simulation at 100 iterations shows that the proposed amplifier has almost the same gain variation with 15.5 dB gain enhancement and about five times output voltage swing expanding for a supply voltage of 1.2V compared with the single closed-loop amplifier using the telescopic opamp.

749,"Among the many scientific advances to come from the study of nanoscience, the development of ligand-targeted nanoparticles to eliminate solid tumors is predicted to have a major impact on human health. There are many reports describing novel designs and testing of targeted nanoparticles to treat cancer. While the principles of the technology are well demonstrated in controlled lab experiments, there are still many hurdles to overcome for the science to mature into truly efficacious targeted nanoparticles that join the arsenal of agents currently used to treat cancer in humans. One of these hurdles is overcoming unwanted biodistribution to the liver while maximizing delivery to the tumor. This almost certainly requires advances in both nanoparticle stealth technology and targeting. Currently, it continues to be a challenge to control the loading of ligands onto polyethylene glycol (PEG) to achieve maximal targeting. Nanoparticle cellular uptake and subcellular targeting of genes and siRNA also remain a challenge. This review examines the types of ligands that have been most often used to target nanoparticles to solid tumors. As the science matures over the coming decade, careful control over ligand presentation on nanoparticles of precise size, shape, and charge will likely play a major role in achieving success.

Using correlations between the cooling rate, traveling speed, and the clad microstructure, a novel feedback PID controller is established to control the cooling rate. The controller is designed to maintain the cooling rate around a desired point by tuning the traveling speed.

Measurements were done with the aircraft on several days with varying wind and weather conditions, while the focus of the study is on the characterisation of the flow field in main wind direction and neutral stratification. It is shown that flow inclination of up to 30 is found over the escarpment, but attenuates within a few hundred metres downstream. The formation of a reattached boundary layer could be measured, as well as an increased turbulence intensity in the reattachment zone.

Of the GCLs examined, one had untreated and two had polymer-enhanced natural sodium bentonite. The three GCLs each had different carriers: one with a woven geotextile, one with a scrim-reinforced nonwoven geotextile, and one with a woven geotextile laminated with a polypropylene film. At some locations, each type of GCL was placed in direct contact with the tailings. At other locations, each GCL was separated from the tailings by 0.15 m of cover soil. Samples of each GCL, tailings, and cover soil were recovered 1 and 2 years after construction. Tests show that the GCL with untreated bentonite maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (= 0.7 m of cover soil above the GCL even though there was significant cation exchange of the sodium in the GCL with divalent cations in the tailings-soil porewater (the mole fraction of sodium (exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP)) decreased from 65% to 10%-17%). The GCL with polymer-enhanced bentonite had a lower hydraulic conductivity (= 0.7 m of cover soil above the GCL) and experienced less cation exchange (ESP decreased to 19%-28%) than the standard GCL. The other GCL with polymer-enhanced bentonite and a carrier geotextile coated with a geofilm demonstrated the best hydraulic performance regardless of the thickness of cover soil or presence of an initially uncontaminated foundation layer. The presence of a foundation layer between the GCL and tailings impeded the migration of arsenic from the tailings into the GCLs. All GCLs were serving as an effective barrier to arsenic migration.

Preserving virtual characters' communicative realism, in particular, joined the ranks of the improvements in natural language technology, and animation algorithms. This paper focuses on culturally relevant paralinguistic cues in nonverbal communication. We model the effects of an Englishspeaking digital character with different accents on human interactants (i. e., users). Our cultural influence model proposes that paralinguistic realism, in the form of accented speech, is effective in promoting culturally congruent cognition only when it is self-relevant to users. For example, a Chinese or Middle Eastern English accent may be perceived as foreign to individuals who do not share the same ethnic cultural background with members of those cultures. However, for individuals who are familiar and affiliate with those cultures (i. e., in-group members who are bicultural), accent not only serves as a motif of shared social identity, it also primes them to adopt culturally appropriate interpretive frames that influence their decision making.

756,"A combination of 3-D vision and X-ray radiography is proposed to enable low-cost, generally applicable online inspection of internal quality of horticultural and potentially other products. The underlying concept assumes that the shape of the product is known beforehand through a deformable shape model. A 3-D vision system is used in combination with the shape model to accurately determine the complete outer surface shape of the sample. This shape is voxelized to generate a reference product from which a X-ray radiograph is simulated to be compared with a measured radiograph, hence revealing the presence of any defects or disorders. Advantages of this method are that small deviations in internal density are detected easily since the cumulative information of the bulk object shape is removed. Furthermore, no specific detection algorithms have to be developed for different types of defects, since the method will directly identify deviations from the ideal. Validation on two datasets and comparison with two reference detections methods (classical image processing and a human operator) shows that the proposed method reliably (accuracy >99%) detect defects larger than 3.5 mm radius with densities differences between sample and defects as small as 10%.

The velocity MMG was measured using a capacitor microphone and a differential circuit, and the MMG, evoked by electrical stimulation, of the tibialis anterior muscle was measured five times in seven healthy young male volunteers. The evoked MMG system was identified using the singular value decomposition method and was approximated with a fourth-order model, which provides two undamped natural frequencies corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse muscle stiffness. The fluctuation of the undamped natural frequencies estimated from the velocity MMG was significantly smaller than that from the acceleration MMG. There was no significant difference between the fluctuations of the undamped natural frequencies estimated from the velocity MMG and that from the displacement MMG. The proposed method using the velocity MMG is thus more advantageous for muscle stiffness estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A filter separator layer between the waste and the drainage layer is shown to reduce the leachate strength entering the gravel drainage layer and to extend the time that it takes to clog the drainage layer to the point when the leachate level exceeds the maximum design value (the service life). The filter layer is shown to have a far more significant effect in extending the service life when pea gravel () is used in the drainage layer, and less effect when coarse gravel () is used in the cases examined, although most of the benefit of a filter separator layer was achieved by using a 3-mm-thick needle-punched nonwoven geotextile. This geotextile may be sufficient for many practical purposes that are similar to those examined. The results from modeling leachate collection systems with filter separator layers subjected to both constant and variable leachate strength show that the characteristics of the leachate entering the drainage layer can substantially affect the service life of the drainage layer, and that high-strength leachate entering the systems for a limited time early in the life (acid phase) of a landfill can greatly reduce the service life of the leachate drainage layer.

Two formulas were derived to calculate the longitudinal restraint stiffness of a double-cable system to the tower and the load distribution between the cables, respectively. A mathematical model of a two-span double-cable suspension bridge was created to verify the formulas. The tower-top displacement and the cable force were obtained by formulas, and the results are in good agreement with the results calculated by the FEM. The effects of some important design parameters on longitudinal restraint were studied. Analysis shows that the restraint stiffness increases with the increasing of unit weight of the bridge, dead load distribution to the top cable, sag ratio of the bottom cable, and elastic stiffness of the cables. Effects of tower-top displacement and span length were also analyzed, and some suggestions were given to design a double-cable suspension bridge.

768,"A key issue in fruit export is classification and sorting for acceptable marketing. In the present work, the image processing technique was employed to grade three varieties of oranges (Bam, Khooni and Thompson) separately. The reason for choosing this fruit as the object of the study was its abundant consumption worldwide. In this study, 14 parameters were extracted: area, eccentricity, perimeter, length/ area, blue value, green value, red value, width, contrast, texture, width/ area, width/ length, roughness, and length. Further, the ANFIS (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System) method was utilized to estimate the orange mass from the data obtained using the image processing in three varieties. In ANFIS model, samples were divided into two sets, one with 70% for training set and the other one with 30% for testing set. The results of the present study demonstrated that the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the best model for Bam, Khooni and Thompson measured 0.948, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively. In addition, the results indicated that the estimation accuracy of the best model for Bam, Khooni and Thompson was measured as +/- 3.7 g, +/- 1.28 g, +/- 3.2 g, respectively. This result was very satisfactory for the application of ANFIS to estimate the orange mass.

To study colon morphology and motor function in female patients with medically refractory chronic constipation with or without uro-gynecological symptoms and to assess clinical outcomes following laparoscopic ileo-proctostomy. Colon anatomy and cecal emptying time were assessed with plain films and fluoroscopy following a standardized test meal mixed with barium. Transit time was determined with radiopaque markers. IBS-QOL and urinary incontinence questionnaires were employed to assess post-colectomy clinical response. In 21 consecutive patients, mean colon transit time (h) was 211.1 +/- 11.3, which was significantly greater than 58.9 +/- 5.1 of 10 normal subjects (P < 0.001). Mega-cecum was found in 15 (Group 1) with mean cecal volume of 587 +/- 27.9 cm(3), significantly greater (P < 0.001) than 169.5 +/- 10.4 cm(3) of six without mega-cecum (Group 2). Mean cecal empting time (days) of barium-mixed feces in Group 1, 4.0 +/- 0.6 was significantly greater than 1.33 +/- 0.21 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Eighteen patients (Groups 1 and 2) who had laparoscopic ileo-proctostomy experienced significantly improved quality of life (P < 0.001). In particular, Group 1 patients benefited significantly from improved uro-gynecological symptoms. Hitherto an unrecognized mega-cecum with markedly impaired emptying function was found in patients with severe slow transit constipation and uro-gynecological symptoms. Subtotal colectomy relieved constipation and improved significantly uro-gynecological symptoms, suggesting strongly that mega-cecum is causally related to these symptoms.

770,"A rectangular plate modeling the roadway of a suspension bridge is considered. Both the contributions of the bending and stretching energies are analyzed. The latter plays an important role due to the presence of the free edges. A linear model is first considered; in this case, separation of variables is used to determine explicitly the deformation of the plate in terms of the vertical load. Moreover, the same method allows us to study the spectrum of the linear operator and the least eigenvalue. Then the stretching energy is introduced without linearization and the equation becomes quasilinear; the nonlinear term also affects the boundary conditions. We consider two quasilinear models; the surface increment model (SIM) in which the stretching energy is proportional to the increment of the surface and a nonlocal model (NLM) introduced by Berger in the 50s (see Berger (1955)). The SIM and the NLM are studied in detail. According to the strength of prestressing we prove the existence of multiple equilibrium positions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

771,"A benchmark problem for modal identification of a cable-stayed bridge was proposed by a research team at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. By taking an instrumented cable-stayed bridge as a test bed, nineteen sets of vibration records with known/unknown excitations were provided to invited researchers. In this paper, the vibration responses of the bridge under a series of excitation conditions are examined to estimate the wind and traffic-induced variations of its dynamic characteristics. Firstly, two output-only experimental modal identification methods are selected. Secondly, the bridge and its monitoring system are described and the nineteen sets of vibration records are analyzed in time-domain and frequency-domain. Excitations sources of blind datasets are predicted based on the analysis of excitation conditions of known datasets. Thirdly, modal parameters are extracted by using the two selected output-only modal identification methods. The identified modal parameters are examined with respect to at least two different conditions such as traffic- and typhoon-induced loadings. Finally, the typhoon-induced effects on dynamic characteristics of the bridge are estimated by analyzing the relationship between the wind velocity and the modal parameters.

It has been validated by simulating several test cases covering different flow regimes including the one dimensional shock tube problem, a two dimensional thermal induced flow and the three dimensional lid-driven cavity flow. The solver features a parallel computing ability based on the velocity space decomposition, which is different from the physical space decomposition based approach provided by the OpenFOAM framework. The two decomposition approaches have been compared in both two and three dimensional cases. The parallel performance improves significantly using the newly implemented approach.

773,"A psychotropic drug is defined as a drug ""capable of affecting the mind, emotions, and behavior; denoting drugs used in the treatment of mental illnesses"" (Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing 2012). Use of these drugs can lead to urinary dysfunction, but it is often difficult to delineate whether urinary dysfunction is a direct/indirect result of drug use or secondary to an unrelated concurrent condition. This situation can therefore result in diagnostic or management dilemmas for urologists, psychiatrists, and primary care physicians. This article reviews the literature published in the last 3 years, and provides an update on the desirable and undesirable effects of psychotropic drugs on lower urinary function. Duloxetine is an antidepressant with efficacy in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. In addition, duloxetine and desipramine have been proposed in the treatment of overactive bladder. Laboratory research into potential therapies which target the role of neurotrophins in lower urinary tract function is in progress. Narcotic analgesia, several antipsychotics, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, and stimulant medications are associated with urinary retention. Several antidepressants have been associated with nocturnal enuresis. Furthermore, ketamine is known to induce storage symptoms, with reduction in bladder capacity. Lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS)-causing drugs are associated with polypharmacy, and elderly patients are particularly susceptible to adverse events due to pharmacotherapy. Awareness of psychotropic drug side effects and rationalization of their use is important to avoid undesirable outcomes. When patients with bothersome LUTS who are on psychotropic drugs fail to benefit from simple first-line treatments for LUTS, clinicians should be mindful that the psychotropic drug may indeed be the cause of LUTS and seek to liaise with the patient's psychiatrist or primary care physician to discuss reasonable alternatives.

774,"A group-delay engineered noncommensurate transmission line two-port all-pass network for analog signal-processing applications is presented, analytically modeled, and experimentally demonstrated. This network consists of transversally cascaded C-sections, which are distributed implementations of the bridged-T equalizer lumped circuit. It is obtained by interconnecting the alternate ports of adjacent lines of a 2N-port coupled transmission line network with transmission line sections, and it is modeled using multiconductor transmission line theory with per-unit-length capacitance matrix C and inductance matrix L. By allowing the different C-sections of the network to exhibit different lengths, a generalized group-delay engineering procedure is proposed, where quasi-arbitrary group-delay responses are achieved by combining the group-delay responses of C-sections with different lengths. A computer design approach based on genetic algorithms is applied for synthesis, which consists of determining the structural parameters of the different C-section groups. Using this approach, noncommensurate networks are group-delay engineered in edge-coupled stripline technology, and Gaussian, linear and quadratic group-delay responses are realized. The theoretical results are validated by experiment. Finally, two application examples of analog signal processing-a tunable impulse delay line and a real-time frequency discriminator-using the proposed dispersive noncommensurate all-pass networks are presented.

Services should support mother and fathers in ways which meet their individual needs. More positive messages should be given to families at diagnosis. AbstractBackground: A diagnosis of childhood autism can be an extremely stressful experience for parents, but little is known concerning paternal perceptions of the process. Methods: This study investigated father perspectives on a diagnosis of autism, through an online survey. Results: An analysis of 184 replies to an open-ended question identified the following themes: strong initial emotional response and a range of immediate anxieties about the future, struggle to gain a diagnosis; anger in response to insensitive delivery of diagnosis together with insufficient information at the time and lack of support afterwards. Conclusion: Fathers experienced a range of significant challenges during a diagnostic process in which most felt unsupported. Service provision should be more gender-differentiated, taking into account of the particular needs and perspectives of both mothers and fathers at this critical juncture in family life.

777,"Absorption or loss is inevitable for the metal-based metamaterials (MMs) due to the intrinsic loss of the metal, and constitutes a major hurdle to the practical realization of most applications such as a sub-wavelength lens. Thus, to reduce the losses becomes one of the major challenges in the MM field. However, the inevitable loss can also be harnessed to take a positive role in the applications of MMs such as stealth technology or other types of cloaking devices. In this presentation, after a brief review of the advances in MMs-based absorbers, we present several schemes to fulfill the desired electromagnetic absorption properties, both linear and nonlinear. For linear absorption, we have experimentally demonstrated that the absorption performance of an ordinary microwave absorbing material can be evidently improved by using the electric resonance resulting from an array of subwavelength metallic circuit elements. For nonlinear absorption, we show theoretically that the active linear magnetic permeability induces a nonlinear absorption, similar to the two-photon absorption (TPA), of electric field in a lossy MM with a Kerr-type nonlinear polarization.

778,"A nonwoven fabric has been widely used in geotextile engineering in recent years; its tensile strength is an important behaviour. Since the fibre distributions in nonwoven fabrics are random and discontinuous, the unit-cell model of a nonwoven fabric cannot be developed to simulate its tensile behaviour. This article presents our research on using finite element method (FEM) to study the tensile behaviour of a nonwoven fabric in macro-scale based on the classical laminate composite theory. The laminate orientation was considered with orientation distribution function of fibres, which has been obtained by analysing the data acquired from scanning electron microscopy with Hough Transform. The FE model of a nonwoven fabric was developed using ABAQUS software; the required engineering constants of a nonwoven fabric were obtained from experimental data. Finally, the nonwoven specimens were stretched along with machine direction and cross direction. The experimental stress-strain curves were compared with the results of FE simulations. The approximate agreement proves the validity of an FE model, which could be used to precisely simulate the stress relaxation, strain creep, bending and shear property of a nonwoven fabric.

779,"A high-efficiency method is proposed to suppress magnetic core imbalance in phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converters. Compared with conventional solutions, such as controlling peak current mode (PCM) or adding DC blocking capacitance, the proposed method has several advantages, such as lower power loss and smaller size, because the additional current sensor or blocking capacitor is removed. A time domain model of the secondary side is built to analyze the relationship between transformer core imbalance and cathode voltage of secondary side rectifiers. An approximate control algorithm is designed to achieve asymmetric phase control, which reduces the effects of imbalance. A 60 V/15 A prototype is built to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that the numerical difference of primary side peak currents between two adjacent cycles is suppressed from 2 A to approximately 0 A. Meanwhile, compared with the PCM solution, the efficiency of the PSFB converter is slightly improved from 93% to 93.2%.

780,"1. Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.

781,"A multimodal damping strategy is implemented by coupling a beam to its analogue electrical network. This network comes from the direct electromechanical analogy applied to a transverse lattice of point masses that represents the discrete model of a beam. The mechanical and electrical structures are connected together through an array of piezoelectric patches. A discrete and a semi-continuous model are proposed to describe the piezoelectric coupling. Both are based on the transfer matrix formulation and consider a finite number of patches. It is shown that a simple coupling condition gives a network that approximates the modal properties of the beam. A multimodal tuned mass effect is then obtained and a wide-band damping is introduced by choosing a suitable positioning for resistors in the network. The strategy and the models are experimentally validated by coupling a free-free beam to a completely passive network. A multimodal vibration reduction is observed, which proves the efficiency of the control solution and its potential in term of practical implementation.

The deck system of the bridge also has some special features. A rubber layer between the concrete slabs and the orthotropic steel deck is used to absorb the vibration energy. In order to study the fatigue behaviour of the orthotropic steel deck, a finite element model is established, and the weld in the rib-to-diaphragm region is modelled by the oblique shell element. After the reference stress was defined, the stress influence lines of the details were calculated, and then the stress ranges were counted by the rain-flow method. The nominal stress method was adopted to assess the fatigue behaviour of the concerned part. Apart from that, the circle form cut out was compared with the key form used in this bridge. Due to the stress dispersing in the concrete slab, the results show that the stress ranges keep at a relatively low level in the details of the two cut out forms. The key form of a cut out is eventually adopted because it is easy to assemble the ribs and diaphragms with a relatively large weld tolerance. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mindfulness interventions are increasingly being implemented in high schools to improve students' stress management and psychosocial outcomes. Despite the well-researched role of primary and secondary control strategies in the management of adolescent stress, the impact of mindfulness on these attributions has not been examined. The current study addressed this gap in the extant literature. A mindfulness-based martial arts program was delivered to 17 high school students at risk for self-regulation challenges. Measures of primary and secondary control and cognitive errors were completed at pre- and post-treatment and compared to a waitlist control (n = 18). Findings suggested that students in the mindfulness program showed significant improvements in secondary control and reductions in cognitive errors from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist control. No significant group by time changes were found for primary control. Findings are discussed in relation to changes in control-related attributions associated with cognitive behavioral therapy, with specific consideration of possible mechanisms by which mindfulness may improve secondary control and decrease cognitive errors.

Symbolic generation ensures automated, accurate, and efficient generation of sensitivity equations. The proposed method of sensitivity analysis avoids differentiation of complicated algebraic expressions, and the corresponding equation swells, by using pre-formed (and stored) expressions that are combined according to the topology captured by the linear graph.

The process of droplet transfer in the AZ31B magnesium alloy DE-GMAW was simulated using FLUENT software. The influence of different bypass welding currents was investigated with a constant total current. The simulated results revealed that when the bypass current was 0 A, the process was the globular transfer type, the droplet transfer with a bypass current of 80 A was a projected transfer type and the droplet transfer at a bypass current of 170 A was a spray transfer type. The critical current is decreased so that spray transfer would occur at a lower current level in the DE-GMAW process. As the bypass current was increased, the shape of droplet changed from oval to round and the transition frequency of the droplet increased in a stepwise fashion. To confirm the accuracy of the simulated results, welding experiments were performed and the image processing method was used to obtain the droplet size.

In the framework of multiresolution analysis, the proposed projection operator wavelet kernel can fulfill the multiscale, multidimensional learning to estimate complex dependencies. The special advantage of the projection operator wavelet kernel developed in this paper lies in the fact that it has a closed-form expression, which greatly facilitates its application in kernel learning. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first closed-form orthogonal projection wavelet kernel reported in the literature. It provides a link between grid-based wavelets and mesh-free kernel-based methods.

800,"Ambient intelligence environments are technologically augmented surroundings that aim to provide personalized services to the users based on their context. Identifying these services for the users has become an increasingly challenging task. The overwhelming number of services in the ambient environment has made the selection and management of services even more challenging. To address this problem, researchers have proposed several techniques, such as creating a user model and selecting services based on that model; applying rule-based approach to match the relevant services; utilizing a combination of user's profile, context, interaction history and service reputation to select the best services for the user, and so on. Most of these techniques obtain the preference of a user based on his/her own interaction and profile and do not consider the power of collaborative selection approach. In this paper, we propose to use the collaborative recommendation technique to select services for a user based on multiple users' interactions and profile. Accordingly, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach through preliminary experiment.

802,"A new image analysis algorithm based on mathematical morphology and pixel classification for grapevine berry counting is presented in this paper. First, a set of berry candidates represented by connected components was extracted. Then, six descriptors were calculated using key features of these components, and were employed for false positive (FP) discrimination using a supervised approach. More specifically, the set of descriptors modelled the grapes' distinctive shape, light reflection pattern and colour. Two classifiers were tested, a three-layer neural network and an optimised support vector machine. A dataset of 152 images was acquired with a low-cost smart phone camera. Images came from seven grapevine varieties, 18 per variety, at the two phenological stages in the Baggiolini scale between berry set (named stage K; 94 images) and cluster-closure (named stage L; 32 images). 126 of these images were kept for external validation and the remaining 26 were used for training (12 at stage L and 14 at K). From these training images, 5438 true/false positive samples were generated and labelled in terms of the six descriptors. The neural network performed better than the support vector machine, yielding consistent Recall and Precision average values of 0.9572 and 0.8705, respectively. The presented algorithm, implemented as a smartphone application, can constitute a useful diagnosis tool for the in-the-field and non-destructive yield prediction and berry set assessing for the grape and wine industry.

803,"A semi-active (SA) control system based on the use of smart magnetorheological (MR) dampers to control the structural response of a wind turbine is proposed herein. The innovative approach is based on the implementation and use of a variable-properties base restraint. This is able to modify in real time its mechanical properties according to the instantaneous decision of a given control logic, the latter addressed to control one or more structural response parameters. The smart base restraint is thought to be a combination of a smooth hinge, elastic springs, large-scale adjustable MR dampers, and a control algorithm that instantaneously commands the latter during the motion, making them to modulate the reactive force as needed to achieve the performance goals. The design and operation of such a system are shown with reference to a case study consisting of an almost 100 m tall wind turbine, realized in a 1/20 scale model at the Denmark Technical University (DTU). Shaking table tests have been performed under the action of two different types of wind loads and by using two purposely written control logics, highlighting the high effectiveness of the proposed SA control technique and encouraging to further investigate in such direction.

804,"A database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer so that it can be consulted by a program to answer queries. Records retrieved through queries become information that can be used to make decisions. A database consists of one or more tables containing records of values for fields that pertain to the attributes of the object being represented by the table. Relational databases contain multiple tables that are linked by means of key fields. A database management system is the computer program that manages the database and queries the data to produce reports of information.

805,"A procedure aimed to support designers in achieving structural improvements to reduce the seismic vulnerability of an electrical network is presented. This method based on the use of ASK4ELP software (Assessment of Seismic Risk for Electric Power Grids) allows minimising the costs of the actions needed in order to reach the required level of reliability, as defined by two different indexes of damage, namely the loss of transmitted power and the number of customers excluded from the service. An updating plan for the reinforcement of a power transmission grid includes the identification of its critical nodes, of the electromechanical components to be strengthened and of the related reinforcement level. In this paper, it is shown how the vulnerability assessment carried out with ASK4ELP can help in finding the optimal solution to these tasks, increasing the effectiveness-to-costs ratio. Three different empirical criteria for the individuation of the critical nodes are evaluated and the simulation of a significant part of the Italian transmission grid is presented: the results suggest that the most effective criterion for individuating the grid critical nodes should be given in terms of their exclusion probability.

806,"A NoSQL, also called a ""Non-Relational"" or ""Not only SQL,"" database system provides an approach to data management and database design for very large sets of distributed data and real-time web applications. A NoSQL database system is also a popular data storage for information retrieval because it supports better scalability, availability, and faster data access while comparing with traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). What the RDBMS data needs is predictable as its data is stored in structured tables by defining the relationship between the different columns. In contrary the data in NoSQL databases does not need to be stored in a structured or fixed fashion. When performance and realtime access are more concerned than consistency, such as indexing and retrieving large numbers of records, NoSQL databases are more suitable than relational databases. With their obvious advantages in better performance, scalability, and flexibility, NoSQL databases have been adopted lately by many small businesses as they are moving their increasing business data into the clouds. However, the research on the security of a specific NoSQL database system or NoSQL database systems in general is very limited. Although there are many storage advantages in NoSQL databases, the need of quick and easy access to data has been seriously affected by the security issue of NoSQL databases. This paper examines the maturity of security measures for MongoDB, a typical NoSQL database system, with aspects in both attack and defense at the code level. The experimental testing on NoSQL injections is performed with JavaScript and PHP. After the demonstration on how a server-side JavaScript injection attack against a NoSQL database system reveals the customer's private data, two methods are discussed in preventing this type of security problems from happening. It is believed that our study will help database developers not only realizing that NoSQL database systems are not designed with security as a priority but also learning how to build a security layer to their organizations' NoSQL applications to avoid NoSQL injections.

807,"A visual breakout prediction method for mold monitoring is proposed based on temperatures measured by thermocouples in the mold combined with the use of computer vision technology. This mold temperature rate thermography allows the characteristics of abnormal temperature regions to be captured and extracted, including the rate of temperature change with time, the geometry, and propagation velocity. On the basis of these characteristics, a back-propagation (BP) neural network model is constructed to detect mold breakout. The weight and threshold values of the model are optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA) through an iterative process of sample training and testing. The results show that the GA-LM-BP neural network model is better than both the traditional BP and the LM-BP models. This breakout prediction model has a higher accuracy rate (83.3 %) and a lower false-alarm rate (0.05 %). The GA-LM-BP model has also been compared with an actual BOPS used in continuous casting production. Meanwhile, it provides a way of detecting abnormalities visually for continuous casting process. The results of this work also provide a positive example of the application of intelligent monitoring and visualization methods to continuous casting.

809,"A four-dimensional visualization approach, featuring three dimensions in space and one dimension in time, is proposed to study local electrode degradation effects during voltage cycling in fuel cells. Noninvasive in situ micro X-ray computed tomography (XCT) with a custom fuel cell fixture is utilized to track the same cathode catalyst layer domain throughout various degradation times from beginning-of-life (BOL) to end-of-life (EOL). With this unique approach, new information regarding damage features and trends are revealed, including crack propagation and catalyst layer thinning being quantified by means of image processing and analysis methods. Degradation heterogeneities as a result of local environmental variations under land and channel are also explored, with a higher structural degradation rate under channels being observed. Density and compositional changes resulting from carbon corrosion and catalyst layer collapse and thinning are observed by changes in relative X-ray attenuation from BOL to EOL, which also indicate possible vulnerable regions where crack initiation and propagation may occur. Electrochemical diagnostics and morphological features observed by micro-XCT are correlated by additionally collecting effective catalyst surface area, double layer capacitance, and polarization curves prior to imaging at various stages of degradation.

810,"As it provides the simultaneous benefits of reducing the demand for potable water and the generation of water runoff, rainwater harvesting (RWH) has received increasing attention from urban water managers in the past decades. This study employs a mass balance based method to estimate RWH performance for four large metropolitan areas of the United States, namely New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Seattle. Geospatial analysis is used in concert with climatic records to characterize the cityscape and climatic patterns of each city and evaluate the RWH systems performance both in terms of potable water savings and roof runoff reductions. The analysis indicates that typical urban rainwater harvesting setups, consisting of a 100 m(2) roof connected to a 5m(3) storage volume, would be able to reduce potable water demand by over 65% in all cities while contextually reduce roof runoff generation by over 75%. Small differences in performance are observed among cities due to differences in precipitation patterns, typical roof area, and population density. Furthermore, an evaluation of the total water savings and runoff reduction for the application of RWH practices at maximum build out for all four study cities is provided, and the sensitivity of our estimates of performance to precipitation patterns and to the systems' operating algorithm is also analyzed and discussed.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important greenhouse gas affected by human activity. About half of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion remains in the atmosphere, contributing to rising temperatures, while the other half is absorbed by natural land and ocean carbon reservoirs. Despite the importance of CO2, many questions remain regarding the processes that control these fluxes and how they may change in response to a changing climate. This visualization shows how column CO2 mixing ratios are strongly affected by local emissions and large-scale weather systems. In order to fully understand carbon flux processes, observations and atmospheric models must work closely together to determine when and where observed CO2 came from. Together, the combination of high-resolution data and models will guide climate models towards more reliable predictions of future conditions. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A 10 mM ammonium acetate adjusted at pH 9 by 3% ammonium hydroxide and including a 5% methanol addition was used as an optimum background electrolyte (BGE). The optimum BGE provided both the baseline electrophoretic separation of the drugs and highly compatible connection of CE to the electro-spray ionization (ESI) interface. The optimized working conditions were favorable for the selective and sensitive QqQ MS detection of the separated compounds according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios.

The effect of the mulching treatments in combination with PRFRH was compared to the conventional flat (control, T-1). The furrow-applied mulching treatments and their designation were: none or bare furrow (T-2); liquid film (T-3); 8% biodegradable film (T-4); 10-cm thick layer of corn stover (T-5); and 0.08mm thick plastic film (T-6). Corn was planted in the furrows on either side of the plastic-covered ridges of the plots for treatments T-2 though T-6. Soil moisture was measured gravimetrically on auger samples taken at 6 locations in each plot at intervals of 20cm from the 0 to 200cm depth. In all years, soil moisture storage at the 0100cm depth was significantly higher (pT-4>T-3>T-2>T-5>T-1, indicating that mulching most likely reduced soil evaporation losses and suggesting that integrated PRFRH+mulch systems has potential to increase crop sustainability in this semiarid region.

The Prevention through Design Adoption Readiness Model (PtD ARM) was employed to develop educational materials, hands-on training, and worksite cues-to-action. Educational materials were targeted to improve worker knowledge of the health risks associated with construction dusts. Hands-on training was developed with the objective of improving worker self-efficacy regarding the new equipment. Additionally cues-to-action were given to the workers.

The proposed method is derived from descriptor system of power system linearized model and complex analysis theory, based on which the computation of eigenvalue number is converted to a set of matrix trace problems. The contour integral results are able to be utilized to detect missing target eigenvalues in partial eigenvalue methods and provide an approximate eigenvalue distribution along the integral curve. Efficient evaluation of integral function is implemented by exploiting the sparsity of descriptor systems. An adaptive integral point collocation strategy is proposed for numerically evaluating contour integral with moderate number of discretized points. As the computation of integral function is decoupled at each integral point, the proposed method features well parallel computing capability.

820,"A number of methods, both algebraic and iterative, have been developed recently for the fitting of concentric circles. Previous studies focus on first-order analysis for performance evaluation, which is appropriate only when the observation noise is small so that the bias is insignificant compared to variance. Further studies indicate that the first-order analysis does not appear sufficient in explaining and predicting the performance of an estimator for the fitting problem, especially when the noise level becomes significant. This paper extends the previous study to perform the second-order analysis and evaluate the estimation bias of several concentric circle estimators. The second-order analysis exposes important characteristics of the estimators that cannot be seen from the first-order studies. The insights gained in the theoretical study have led to the development of a new estimator that is unbiased and performs best among the algebraic solutions. An adjusted maximum likelihood estimator is also proposed that can yield an unbiased estimate while maintaining the KCR bound performance.

821,"A MapReduce algorithm can be described by a mapping schema, which assigns inputs to a set of reducers, such that for each required output there exists a reducer that receives all the inputs participating in the computation of this output. Reducers have a capacity that limits the sets of inputs they can be assigned. However, individual inputs may vary in terms of size. We consider, for the first time, mapping schemas where input sizes are part of the considerations and restrictions. One of the significant parameters to optimize in any MapReduce job is communication cost between the map and reduce phases. The communication cost can be optimized by minimizing the number of copies of inputs sent to the reducers. The communication cost is closely related to the number of reducers of constrained capacity that are used to accommodate appropriately the inputs, so that the requirement of how the inputs must meet in a reducer is satisfied. In this work, we consider a family of problems where it is required that each input meets with each other input in at least one reducer. We also consider a slightly different family of problems in which each input of a list, X, is required to meet each input of another list, Y, in at least one reducer. We prove that finding an optimal mapping schema for these families of problems is NP-hard, and present a bin-packing-based approximation algorithm for finding a near optimal mapping schema.

Our aim was to define the molecular alterations underlying metastasis formation. Gene expression profiling was performed using microarray and qRT-PCR to define alterations between matched primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines. These data were integrated with publicly available unmatched tissue data. The invasiveness of cell lines was determined by Matrigel invasion assays and invasive clones from primary melanoma-derived cell lines were also selected. Two metastatic cell line models were created: the regional lymph node WM983A-WM983A(INV)-WM983B and the distant lung WM793B-WM793B(INV)-1205Lu metastatic models. The majority of metastasis genes were downregulated and enriched in adhesion and ITGA6-B4 pathways. Upregulation of immune pathways was characteristic of distant metastases, whereas increased Rap1 signaling was specific for regional (sub) cutaneous metastases. qRT-PCR analysis of selected integrins (A2, A3, A4, A9, B5, B8, A6, B1, and B3) highlighted the possible importance of ITGA3/4 and B8 in the metastatic process, distinguishing regional and distant metastases. We identified functionally relevant gene clusters that influenced metastasis formation.

823,"A new data-driven model has been developed to determine 1D/2D particle size distribution (PSD) from measured FBRM chord-length distribution (CLD) data. The structure of the model consists of three steps: first, the measured CLDs are compressed down to a small set of parameters; second, these parameters are correlated with low order moments or a small number of percentiles of the PSD using regression models; third, the PSD low order moments are used as input variables, and a two layer-network sub-model is built to predict the PSD in a form of a histogram. Two key aspects of this modeling strategy are noteworthy, namely the construction of specialized parameterized functions (herein called generating functions) that reduce the number of parameters needed to train the model's two layer network component, as well as its ability to model a 2D size distribution. To demonstrate this paradigm, the model was used to determine the PSD of particles with an elongated morphology. It is shown that even with a limited data set, models could be trained to predict PSD generated by laser diffraction, minor size PSD generated by image analysis, and 2D minor-major PSD measured by image analysis.

Due to the lack of practicable exact solutions, it has been attracted by the researchers working on heuristic based suboptimal search algorithms. With the recent inclusion of multiple objectives such as minimizing the cost, maximizing, the throughput and maximizing the reliability, the problem gets even more complex and an efficient approximate method becomes more valuable. In this work, I propose a new solution for the multi-objective task allocation problem. My solution consists in designing a problem-specific neighboring function for an existing metaheuristic algorithm that is proven to be successful in quadratic assignment problems. The neighboring function, namely greedy reassignment with maximum release (GR-MR), provides a dynamic mechanism to switch the preference of the search between the exploration and exploitation. The experiments validate both that the quality of the solutions are close to the optimal and the proposed method performs significantly better comparing to three other metaheuristic algorithms. Neighboring functions being the common reusable components of metaheuristic algorithms, GR-MR can also be utilized by other metaheuristic-based solutions in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A Hammerstein system is used to model the controlled process (linear block) and the sticky valve (nonlinear block): five different candidates for the linear block and two different candidates for the nonlinear block are evaluated and compared. Two of the five linear models include a nonstationary disturbance term that is estimated along with the input-to-output model, and these extended models are meant to cope with situations in which significant nonzero mean disturbances affect the collected data. The comparison of the different models and identification methods is carried out thoroughly in three steps: simulation, application to pilot plant data and application to industrial loops. In the first two cases (simulation and pilot plant) the specific source of fault (stiction with/without external disturbances) is known and hence a validation of each candidate can be carried out more easily. Nonetheless, each fault case considered in the previous two steps has been found in the application to a large number of datasets collected from industrial loops, and hence the merits and limitations of each candidate have been confirmed. As a result of this study, extended models are proved to be effective when large, time varying disturbances affect the system, whereas conventional (stationary) noise models are more effective elsewhere.

Besides, the adsorption of aniline over SiO2, MIL-68(Al), the physical mixture of these two materials, and SiO2@MIL-68(Al) composites was investigated comparatively, demonstrating a relatively high adsorption capacity (531.9 mg g(-1)) of 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) towards aniline. Combining the ultrafast adsorption dynamics (reaching equilibrium within 40 s) and great reusability, 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) shows excellent adsorption performance. This indicates that the SiO2@MIL-68(Al) composites possess great potential applications as a kind of fascinating adsorbent in water pollution protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

835,"A multitude of contemporary applications now involve graph data whose size continuously grows and this trend shows no signs of subsiding. This has caused the emergence of many distributed graph processing systems including Pre-gel and Apache Giraph. However, the unprecedented scale now reached by real-world graphs hardens the task of graph processing even in distributed environments and the current memory usage patterns rapidly become a primary concern for such contemporary graph processing systems. We seek to address this challenge by exploiting empirically-observed properties demonstrated by graphs that are generated by human activity. In this paper, we propose three space-efficient adjacency list representations that can be applied to any distributed graph processing system. Our suggested compact representations reduce respective memory requirements for accommodating the graph elements up to 5 times if compared with state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, our memory-optimized methods retain the efficiency of uncompressed structures and enable the execution of algorithms for large scale graphs in settings where contemporary alternative structures fail due to memory errors.

836,"A large number of methods have been applied to evaluate genotoxic damage in different aquatic species. Comet assay, as a method for detecting DNA alterations, and micronucleus test, as an index of chromosomal damage are the most widely used and authentic methods in laboratory and field studies. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the genotoxic effects of heavy metals generated by toxic industrial effluents and various kinds of pollutants from urban and agricultural areas and domestic waste on Catla catla and Cirrhinus mrigala due to water pollution in the Chenab River, Pakistan. The heavy metals Cd, Cu, Mn. Zn, Pb, Cr, Sn, and Hg were detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometry from water samples collected from predetermined sampling sites. All the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals were found to exceed the upper limits recommended by various agencies. Comet assays showed significant (p < 0.05) DNA damage in C. mrigala compared to C. catla for tail length and olive tail moment from three different sites. Significant (p0.05) findings were observed between fish collected from farmed and non-polluted upstream waters. Micronucleus assays showed similar findings for single and double micronucleus induction in C. catla and C. mrigala. A significantly (p < 0.05) higher micronuclei induction and percent tail DNA was observed in C. mrigala specimen collected from the polluted site. These findings infer that DNA damage could be used as a biomarker of pollution load and its early monitoring by using simple and reliable techniques such as the comet and micronucleus assays, expedient methods for toxicity screening of aquatic environments. Regular monitoring is necessary to assess eco-health of the Chenab River by choosing perhaps C. mrigala, being a bottom feeder, as a bioindicator that could provide more reliable information to determine the status of the environmental quality of the river.

Viral infections may be associated with IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases. In the present study, we investigate for the first time in Iran the related viral etiology of IPF in order to detect three respiratory viruses; human adenovirus, enterovirus and bocavirus. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study which was supported by Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The diagnostic criteria for IPF were based on internationally accepted clinical and imaging criteria in accordance with the 2011 IPF guidelines. 30 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained from the lung of IPF patients that were diagnosed by a sophisticated practitioner from April 2015 to February 2016. Real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was performed to detect the three viruses. Fluorescence dye of a labeled probe recorded the results in order to create positive and negative controls. SPSS version 20 software was used to calculate basic descriptive and frequency features. Results: Of 30 specimens, 13 (43.4%) were male and 17 (56.6%) were female with the total mean age standard deviation 68.2 +/- 12.0. RT-PCR assay results illustrated there was no infection of human adenovirus, enterovirus, and bocavirus detected in these samples. Significant results between IPF incidence and variables were not significant (p >0.05). Conclusion: The causes of IPF in Iranian patients need more research although, based on the results of this study, there was no association between human adenovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus, and IPF. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

838,"A pod is a propeller propulsion device installed externally to the ship's hull. The pod system comprises a short propulsion shaft, on which the propulsion electric motor is mounted. In most cases, propulsion is achieved by means of fixed pitch propellers powered by an AC synchronous motor (conventional, permanent magnet) or asynchronous electric motor, fitted inside the pod. Amongst the highest failure indices are those of main electric motor parts, such as the stator windings and core, the rotor windings and the slip ring electric connectors. These high failure rates are attributed mainly to the high temperature development in windings, leading to excessive overheating stresses, indicating that the motors have not been properly selected according to the stressful conditions they are subject to operate in. This paper deals with the design procedure of a surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor for application as a podded main propulsion motor. Specifically, it is an Azipod system that is an outboard marine propulsion unit, in which the engine is out of the hull, is rotatable around itself and the shaft is directly connected to the propeller.

839,"Accurate estimates of biomass are required for relating ecosystem functioning to atmospheric carbon regulation. Biomass may be directly measured through field sampling, which can then be used to calibrate biomass predictions from remote sensing and/or modelling. Field sampling generally entails measuring the fresh mass of individual trees or shrubs and then estimating the moisture contents of a representative sub-samples, which are then used to calculate dry mass. Because any errors in the estimation of the moisture content (MC) correction are translated proportionally to the biomass prediction of an individual tree or shrub, care is required to ensure MC estimates are unbiased and as precise as possible. There are numerous different protocols currently applied to attain MC, with these differing in accuracy (bias and precision) and cost of implementation. A dataset of MC of above-ground biomass (AGB) of 1396 individuals (trees or shrubs) was used to assess which protocols for within- and among-individual sampling are likely to provide the most cost-effective estimates of MC within acceptable bounds of accuracy. Monte Carlo analysis was used to explore key sources of error in within-individual MC estimation. Results suggest these MC estimates may be based on at least the bole and crown components of AGB, with bias resulting if MC is based on stem wood only, particularly in young (or small) individuals. Little gain in accuracy was attained with more intensive sub-sampling (e.g. into foliage, twig, branches, bark, and stem wood components). Moreover, further efficiencies may be gained by applying existing empirical models to estimate the proportion of AGB that is crown based on easily measured variables such as stem diameter, thereby avoiding the resource-intensive process of partitioning to obtain fresh weights measurements of components. However to minimise bias, it is important to undertake MC sampling at each study site, and to stratify sampling among-individuals by both appropriate taxonomic grouping (e.g. plant functional type) and age-class. For a given plant functional type-by-size (or age) strata at a given site a precision of about 4% coefficient of variation of the average MC estimate can be achieved with intensive within- and among-individual sampling. However a precision of 8-10% is achievable using our recommended less intensive but more efficient protocol; derive an average MC for at least six individuals, and for each individual, intensively sub-sample bole and crown components for MC, which is then applied to the fresh weights of these components. This latter estimate may be obtained from partitioning of the AGB, or for the highest efficiency, from predictions obtained from the application of existing representative empirical relationships of partitioning based on the size of the individual.

840,"Abnormal buildup of the microtubule associated protein tau is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various tauopathies. The mechanisms by which pathological tau accumulates and spreads throughout the brain remain largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that a restoration of the major astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT1, ameliorated a buildup of tau pathology and rescued cognition in a mouse model of AD. We hypothesized that aberrant extracellular glutamate and abnormal neuronal excitatory activities promoted tau pathology. In the present study, we investigated genetic interactions between tau and the GLT1 homolog dEaatl in Drosophila melanogaster. Neuronal-specific overexpression of human wildtype tau markedly shortened lifespan and impaired motor behavior. RNAi depletion of dEaatl in astrocytes worsened these phenotypes, whereas overexpression of dEaatl improved them. However, the synaptic neuropil appeared unaffected, and we failed to detect any major neuronal loss with tau overexpression in combination with dEaatl depletion. To mimic glutamate-induced aberrant excitatory input in neurons, repeated depolarization of neurons via transgenic TrpA1 was applied to the adult Drosophila optic nerves, and we examined the change of tau deposits. Repeated depolarization significantly increased the accumulation of tau in these neurons. We propose that increased neuronal excitatory activity exacerbates tau mediated neuronal toxicity and behavioral deficits. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

842,"A new approach for the unified treatment of frictional contact and orthotropic plasticity at finite strains using semi-smooth Newton methods is presented. The contact discretization is based on the well-known mortar finite element method using dual Lagrange multipliers to facilitate the handling of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom. Exploiting the similarity of the typical inequality constraints of plasticity and friction, all involved discrete inequalities are reformulated as nonlinear non-smooth equations using complementarity functions. The resulting set of discrete semi-smooth equations can be solved efficiently by a variant of Newton's method, where all additionally introduced variables are condensed from the global system so that a linear system only consisting of the displacement degrees of freedom has to be solved in each iteration step. In contrast to classical radial return mapping methods for computational plasticity, the plastic constraints are not required to hold at every iterate in the nonlinear solution procedure, but only at convergence. This relaxation in the pre-asymptotic behavior results in an increased flexibility regarding algorithm design and a potentially higher robustness compared to radial return mapping algorithms. The presented elasto-plasticity algorithm includes arbitrary isotropic hyperelasticity, an anisotropic Hill-type yield function with isotropic and kinematic hardening, plastic spin and appropriate finite element technology for nearly incompressible materials. Therefore, it is well suited for the modeling of sheet metal forming and similar processes. Several numerical examples underline the robustness of the proposed plasticity algorithm and the efficient treatment of elasto-plastic contact problems. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The simulation environment of Eldo (TM) using AMI05 (American Microsystems Inc.) technology provided by Mentor Graphics Corporation is used for noise optimization of a low power CMOS charge amplifier. Using simulation tools we have designed and simulated the output of the charge amplifier and have calculated the power consumption, band width, gain and Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC) of the circuit. We have also studied the factors on which noise of amplifier depends. This has resulted in a noise performance of ENC = 116 electrons at 0 pF detector capacitance with a power consumption of 80 mu W per channel. Due to its very low noise and low power consumption, this kind of new charge amplifier can be widely used in research in the fields of Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics and X-ray detection.

The prevalence of HCV infection among dialysis patients in Japan, Europe, and North America during the 2012 to 2015 period was found to be 8.7% in the DOPPS study. Nosocomial HCV spread in hemodialysis facilities still occurs. Increased hepatic tissue iron has been shown to play a deleterious role in the course of hepatitis C, favor development of fibrosis and cirrhosis and possibly increase the risk of liver cancer in the general population. Regular loss of blood in the hemodialysis circuit, in routine blood sampling for laboratory tests (for uremia monitoring), and in gut due to uremic enteropathy, invariably results in iron deficiency for which patients are commonly treated with intravenous (IV) iron preparations. Data on the effects of IV iron in hemodialysis patients with hepatitis C are limited (2 studies) and strongly suggest that parenteral iron may contribute to hepatocellular injury. Iatrogenic iron overload is extremely prevalent among hemodialysis population worldwide. Iron overload and toxicity has emerged as one of the most controversial topic in the management of anemia in dialysis patients. Given the known impact of iron in promoting growth and virulence of HCV and the associated liver disease, it is necessary to use iron therapy cautiously and closely monitor plasma markers of iron metabolism and liver iron stores non-invasively by means of MRI to avoid iron overload in this vulnerable population.

IIPs involve varying combinations of fibrosis and inflammation of unknown cause and may be associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH).

However, whether or when PH is a maladaptive versus adaptive phenomenon remains to be determined. Despite their differing prognoses, it does appear that the IIPs may follow a similar course once PH supervenes. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to explore studies of PH medications in IIP as a group rather than as individual entities. Such a broad approach eliminates the need to nuance specific diagnoses and thereby facilitates study recruitment and broadens the applicability of the results. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Depression filling is an important preconditioning step to many of these algorithms. Here, I present a new, linearly scaling algorithm which parallelizes the Priority-Flood depression-filling algorithm by subdividing a DEM into tiles. Using a single-producer, multi-consumer design, the new algorithm works equally well on one core, multiple cores, or multiple machines and can take advantage of large memories or cope with small ones. Unlike previous algorithms, the new algorithm guarantees a fixed number of memory access and communication events per subdivision of the DEM. In comparison testing, this results in the new algorithm running generally faster while using fewer resources than previous algorithms. For moderately sized tiles, the algorithm exhibits similar to 60% strong and weak scaling efficiencies up to 48 cores, and linear time scaling across datasets ranging over three orders of magnitude. The largest dataset on which I run the algorithm has 2 trillion (2 x 10(12)) cells. With 48 cores, processing required 4.8 h wall-time (93 compute-days). This test is three orders of magnitude larger than any previously performed in the literature. Complete, well commented source code and correctness tests are available for download from a repository.

We investigated whether this SNP had any effect on the dynamics of CMV-specific T-cell immunity in these patients. CMV pp65/IE-1 IFN-gamma CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were enumerated by flow cytometry in 85 patients with no prior CMV DNAemia (group A) and in 57 after the onset of CMV DNAemia (group B). Donor IL28B genotype was determined by real-time PCR and plasma levels of IL-28B were quantitated by ELISA. CMV-specific T-cell counts and plasma IL-28B levels in patients in group A were not significantly different among the IL28B genotype groups. Patients harboring the donor IL28B T/T genotype appeared to expand CMV-specific IFN-gamma CD8(+) cells to a higher level in response to viral replication than their C/T and C/C counterparts. Fewer patients in the T/T group received pre-emptive antiviral therapy (P = 0.05). Overall, a significant inverse correlation was observed between median IL-28B levels measured prior to the CMV DNAemia onset and the level of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells enumerated after detection of CMV DNAemia (s = -0.471; P = 0.013). In summary, the data suggested that the protective effect attributed to the rs12979860 SNP minor T allele could be mediated, at least in part, by eliciting robust CMV-specific T-cell responses.

851,"A modern understanding of how cerebral cortical lesions develop after acute brain injury is based on Aristides Le (a) over tilde $o's historic discoveries of spreading depression and asphyxial/anoxic depolarization. Treated as separate entities for decades, we now appreciate that these events define a continuum of spreading mass depolarizations, a concept that is central to understanding their pathologic effects. Within minutes of acute severe ischemia, the onset of persistent depolarization triggers the breakdown of ion homeostasis and development of cytotoxic edema. These persistent changes are diagnosed as diffusion restriction in magnetic resonance imaging and define the ischemic core. In delayed lesion growth, transient spreading depolarizations arise spontaneously in the ischemic penumbra and induce further persistent depolarization and excitotoxic damage, progressively expanding the ischemic core. The causal role of these waves in lesion development has been proven by real-time monitoring of electrophysiology, blood flow, and cytotoxic edema. The spreading depolarization continuum further applies to other models of acute cortical lesions, suggesting that it is a universal principle of cortical lesion development. These pathophysiologic concepts establish a working hypothesis for translation to human disease, where complex patterns of depolarizations are observed in acute brain injury and appear to mediate and signal ongoing secondary damage.

Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them.

The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view.

Unfortunately, these algorithms are too time consuming, and so the reactive, nature-inspired algorithms using a limited number of fitness function evaluations are proposed in this paper. Two reactive evolutionary algorithms (differential evolution and genetic algorithm), and four reactive, swarm intelligence-based algorithms (bat, hybrid bat, particle swarm optimization and cuckoo search), were used to tune the PID controller in our comparative study.

Input thermal energy can be provided by the means of solar collectors, as well as other low temperature energy sources. In the following article, ""thermo-hydraulic"" term refers to a process involving an incompressible fluid used as an intermediate medium to transfer work hydraulically between different thermal operated components or sub-systems. The system aims at providing trigeneration energy features for the residential sector, that is providing heating, cooling and electrical power for meeting the energy needs of domestic houses. This innovative system is made of two dithermal processes (working at two different levels of temperatures) and featuring two different working fluids. The first process is able to directly supply either electrical energy generated by an hydraulic turbine or drives the second process thanks to the incompressible fluid, which is similar to a heat pump effect for heating or cooling purposes. The innovative aspect of this process relies on the use of an hydraulic transfer fluid to transfer the work between each sub-system and therefore simplifying the conversion chain. A model, assuming steady-state operation, is developed to assess the energy performances of different variants of this thermo-hydraulic process with various heat source temperatures (80-110 degrees C) or heat sinks (0-30 degrees C), as well as various pairs of working fluids. For instance, in the frame of a single-family home, located in the Mediterranean region, the working fluid pairs (R1234yf/R1233zd) is investigated in detail in order to estimate the annual performances. For domestic houses, the process aims at amplifying the solar energy collected by a factor of 1.32 for heating purpose, provides a cold production with a coefficient of performance of 0.4 and generates electricity from the remaining solar energy with an efficiency of 3.7%, reducing the electrical or auxiliary consumption and overall greenhouse gas emissions.

AS-AR does not publicize the destination address in the address-resolution process and hides the IP and MAC addresses of the source node. The malicious node cannot obtain the addresses of the destination and the node which initiates the address resolution; thus, it cannot attack. Analyses and experiments show that AS-AR has a higher security level than existing security methods, such as secure-neighbor discovery.

865,"Analyzing retrieval accuracy and precision is an important element of space-based CO2 retrievals. However, this error analysis is sometimes challenging to perform rigorously because of the subtlety of Multivariate Statistics. To help address this issue, we revisit some fundamentals of Multivariate Statistics that help reveal the statistical essence of the associated error analysis. We show that the related statistical methodology is useful for revealing the intrinsic discrepancy and relation between the retrieval error for a nonzero-variate CO2 state and that for a zero-variate one. Our study suggests that the two scenarios essentially yield the same-magnitude accuracy, while the latter scenario yields a better precision than the former. We also use this methodology to obtain a rigorous framework systematically and explore a broadly used approximate framework for analyzing CO2 retrieval errors. The approximate framework introduces errors due to an essential, but often forgotten, fact that a priori climatology in reality is never equal to the true state. Due to the nature of the problem considered, realistic numerical simulations that produce synthetic spectra may be more appropriate than remote sensing data for our specific exploration. As highlighted in our retrieval simulations, utilizing the approximate framework may not be universally satisfactory in assessing the accuracy and precision of Xco(2) retrievals (with errors up to 0.17-0.28ppm and 1.4-1.7ppm, respectively, at SNR=400). In situ measurements of CO2 are needed to further our understanding of this issue and related implications.

However, long-term safety and efficacy have not been proved high level evidence based medicine. We have performed an open-label, multicenter, phase III study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of bilastine, a novel non-sedating H-1-antihistamine for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) or pruritus associated with skin diseases (trial registration no. JapicCTI-142528). Patients aged 18-74 years were treated with bilastine 20 mg once daily for up to 52 weeks. Safety and tolerability were assessed on the basis of adverse events (AE), bilastine-related AE, laboratory tests and vital signs. Efficacy was assessed based on rash score, itch score, overall improvement and quality of life. One hundred and ninety-eight patients enrolled, 122 of whom (61.6%) completed the 52-week treatment period. AE were reported in 64.5% and bilastine-related AE in 2.5% of patients throughout the 52-week treatment period. All AE were mild to moderate in severity. AE associated with the nervous system occurred in 10 patients (5.1%) including seven patients (3.6%) with headache. Somnolence reported in two of these patients (1.0%) was related to bilastine. All efficacy variables improved during treatment with bilastine. In conclusion, long-term treatment with bilastine 20 mg once daily for 52 weeks is safe and well tolerated in Japanese patients with CSU or pruritus associated with skin diseases. Bilastine improved disease symptoms of both conditions early in treatment, and the efficacy was maintained throughout the treatment.

A high security communication flow path is not useful when the network path cannot support capacity and reachability requirements.

The multiphysics simulation characterizes multidisciplinary, including electrical, thermal, and mechanical, aspects of interconnects. It is well known that the major bottleneck preventing 3-D simulations from gaining further popularity is the computational efficiency in dealing with practically large-scale problems. To address this problem, the proposed multiphysics simulation is devised for analyzing large-scale problems with a significantly improved computational efficiency through utilizing a domain decomposition scheme called the finite element tearing and interconnecting, parallel computing, and the localized nature of thermal stresses in the interconnect structures. Both the capability and efficiency of the multiphysics simulation are demonstrated through analyzing large-scale interconnect structures including arrays of solder bumps and bonding wires. Detailed temperature distributions and localized stresses of large amplitude are obtained through the proposed simulation in a highly efficient manner.

869,"A study on the thermal performance of the Tamar Suspension Bridge deck in Plymouth, UK, is presented in this paper. Ambient air, suspension cable, deck and truss temperatures were acquired using a wired sensor system. Deck extension data were acquired using a two-hop wireless sensor network. Empirical models relating the deck extension to various combinations of temperatures were derived and compared. The most accurate model, which used all the four temperature variables, predicted the deck extension with an accuracy of 99.4%. Time delays ranging from 10 to 66 min were identified between the daily cycles of the air temperature and of the structural temperatures and deck extension. However, accounting for these delays in the temperature-extension models did not improve the models' prediction accuracy. The results of this study suggest that bridge design recommendations are based on overly simplistic assumptions which could result in significant errors in the estimated deck movement, especially for temperature extremes. These findings aim to help engineers better understand the important aspect of thermal performance of steel bridges. This paper also presents a concise study on the effective use of off-the-shelf wireless technology to support structural health monitoring of bridges.

For this purpose, information about the electrical network, such as the current, the voltage or the power, is gathered together over time so that the behaviour of suppliers and consumers can be observed and automatically coordinated.

A novel and innovative quantitative approach based on, both, homogenous and heterogeneous estimators was used for this purpose. The results of the no-spurious estimations (the Augmented Mean Group Estimator) show that the price elasticity of gas demand is significantly negative and within the -0.44 to -0.48 range. In contrast, the price elasticity of electricity demand is not statistically significant. The income elasticities show the opposite pattern: those of natural gas are not statistically significant, whereas the income elasticities for electricity are statistically significant and within the 0.22 to 0.29 range.

875,"A series elastic actuator (SEA) is a promising actuation method in force control applications that intelligently interacts with environments. The SEA is characterized by a spring placed between a load and an actuator, which is an electric motor in most cases. Since the spring plays the role of a transducer between position (i.e., the spring deflection) and force, it is able to control the output force (torque) precisely by utilizing typical position control methods. However, the force control performance of the SEA is considered to have limitations due to its elasticity, and thus, to be inferior to rigid actuators in terms of bandwidth. This paper proposes that the force control performance of the SEA can be improved by exploiting the dynamic model of the SEA. To this end, the SEA is modeled and analyzed utilizing the two-mass dynamic model, which is a well-known and widely accepted model of the flexible system. The disturbance observer and feedforward controller are introduced as the model-based control algorithms for the SEA to achieve the high-precision force control. In addition to high-bandwidth force control, the proposed controller can address the robust stability and performance against model parameter variance and exogenous disturbances. For the analytic and quantitative assessment of the proposed force control system, the dynamic characteristics of an SEA under various control algorithms are analyzed, and the experimental results are provided for an actual SEA system in this paper.

876,"A novel output-only subspace identification method is proposed to estimate the structural parameters of a shear-beam building under unknown ground excitation. The unique feature of the method is that both the structural parameters and the ground acceleration can be identified using only the absolute acceleration response, and no displacement and velocity responses are required. The method uses two subspace identification techniques sequentially and iteratively. The first technique extracts modal parameters of the building (natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes) using the absolute acceleration response and assumed or identified ground acceleration. These modal parameters further lead to the estimation of the building's structural parameters when the mass properties of the building are known. The second technique then estimates the ground acceleration using the absolute acceleration and the obtained structural parameters from the first technique. The two techniques are performed iteratively until the estimated structural parameters converge. A numerical example and a laboratory test are used to illustrate the proposed identification method. Results show that the estimation of structural parameters is fairly robust to the presence of measurement noise while the unknown ground acceleration is not in high frequency range. Factors influencing the performance of the technique are also studied and discussed.

To protect the electrorefining vessel, made of 9Cr-1Mo steel from the attack by the electrolyte, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic coating was deposited on 9Cr-1Mo steel by thermal spray process.

For this purpose, we present a novel mathematical model of meminductor, which considers the effects of internal state variable and therefore will be more consistent with future actual meminductor device. By using several operational amplifiers, multipliers, capacitors and resistors, the equivalent circuit of the model is designed for exploring its characteristics. This equivalent circuit can be employed to design meminductor-based application circuits as a meminductor emulator. By employing simulation experiment, we investigate the characteristics of this meminductor driven by sinusoidal excitation. The characteristic curves of current-flux (i-phi), voltage-flux (v-phi), v-rho (internal variable of meminductor) and phi-rho for the meminductor model are given by theoretical analyses and simulations. The curve of current-flux (i-phi) is a pinched hysteretic loop passing through the origin. The area bounding each sub-loop deforms as the frequency varies, and with the increase of frequency, the shape of the pinched hysteretic loop tends to be a straight line, indicating a dependence on frequency for the meminductor. Based on the meminductor model, a meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic oscillator is designed and analyzed. Some dynamical properties, including equilibrium points and the stability, bifurcation and Lyapunov exponent of the oscillator, are investigated in detail by theoretical analyses and simulations. By utilizing Lyapunov spectrum, bifurcation diagram and dynamical map, it is found that the system has periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic states. Furthermore, there exist some complicated nonlinear phenomena for the system, such as constant Lyapunov exponent spectrum and nonlinear amplitude modulation of chaotic signals. Moreover, we also find the nonlinear phenomena of coexisting bifurcation and coexisting attractors, including coexistence of two different chaotic attractors and coexistence of two different periodic attractors. The phenomenon shows that the state of this oscilator is highly sensitive to its initial valuse, not only for chaotic state but also for periodic state, which is called coexistent oscillation in this paper. The basic mechanism and potential applications of the existing attractors are illustrated, which can be used to generate robust pseudo random sequence, or multiplexed pseudo random sequence. Finally, by using the equivalent circuit of the proposed meminducive model, we realize an analog electronic circuit of the meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic system. The results of circuit experiment are displayed by the oscilloscope, which can verify the chaotic characteristics of the oscillator.

In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the River Wensum catchment in eastern England with the aim of quantifying the long-term impacts of potential changes to agricultural management practices on river water quality. Calibration and validation were successfully performed at a daily time-step against observations of discharge, nitrate and total phosphorus obtained from high-frequency water quality monitoring within the Blackwater sub-catchment, covering an area of 19.6 km(2). A variety of mitigation options were identified and modelled, both singly and in combination, and their long-term effects on nitrate and total phosphorus losses were quantified together with the 95% uncertainty range of model predictions. Results showed that introducing a red clover cover crop to the crop rotation scheme applied within the catchment reduced nitrate losses by 19.6%. Buffer strips of 2 m and 6 m width represented the most effective options to reduce total phosphorus losses, achieving reductions of 12.2% and 16.9%, respectively. This is one of the first studies to quantify the impacts of agricultural mitigation options on long-term water quality for nitrate and total phosphorus at a daily resolution, in addition to providing an estimate of the uncertainties of those impacts. The results highlighted the need to consider multiple pollutants, the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions and the risk of unintended pollutant impacts when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation options, and showed that high-frequency water quality datasets can be applied to robustly calibrate water quality models, creating DSTs that are more effective and reliable.

891,"A cochlear implant (CI), also called a bionic ear or electronic cochlea, is an implantable electronic device that can partially restore hearing to profoundly deaf patients by directly stimulating the patient's auditory nerve via surgically implanted electrode arrays. Hearing impairment of the severely deaf patients translates into a 70-80 dB hearing loss, reaching a hearing dynamic range as low as 15-25 dB. As such, gain control systems are needed in CIs to map the acoustic input signal into the patient's hearing dynamic range. This paper proposes a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) which can be used to implement a dual-loop automated gain control (AGC). An analog signal processing technique is used, due to its advantages over the digital processing equivalents, such as potentially lower power consumption and higher processing speed. Programming the analog processing parameters, i.e. gain levels and time constants, is done by means of digital control words that set the values of corresponding bias currents. Computation of the control words is done in a digital fashion, allowing a hardware description language implementation of the gain control algorithm. This adds flexibility to the resulting gain control system: ability to choose between a feed-forward and feed-back topology, ability to choose between different compression functions: linear, logarithmic and power-law, and ability to set the desired compression limits Finally, a fully adaptive gain control system is implemented. The programmable aspect of the adaptive AGC implementation also enables the adjustment of the AGC operation to meet the patient's individual needs. Circuit simulation proves the functionality of the proposed PGA for automated gain control in CI applications.

896,"Age-associated changes in lung structure and function are some of the most important predictors of overall health, cognitive activities and longevity. Common to all aging cells is an increase in oxidatively modified DNA bases, primarily 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG). It is repaired via DNA base excision repair pathway driven by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1-BER), whose role in aging has been the focus of many studies. This study hypothesizes that signaling and consequent gene expression during cellular response to OGG1-BER ""wires"" senescence/aging processes. To test OGG1-BER was mimicked by repeatedly exposing diploid lung fibroblasts cells and airways of mice to 8-oxoG base. Results showed that repeated exposures led to G1 cell cycle arrest and pre-matured senescence of cultured cells in which over 1000 genes were differentially expressed 86% of them been identical to those in naturally senesced cells. Gene ontology analysis of gene expression displayed biological processes driven by small GTPases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen activated kinase cascades both in cultured cells and lungs. These results together, points to a new paradigm about the role of DNA damage and repair by OGG1 in aging and age-associated disease processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

897,"Agave americana L. fibers, the most abundant variety in Tunisia, have a quite important textile potential. This potential is demonstrated by studying the extraction of these fibers from leaves, their physical properties such us fineness or density and their mechanical behavior in tensile tests. In this work, results of a mechanical behavior study of fibers extracted from the Agave americana L. plant are presented. These results deal with the principal and mechanical characteristics of these fibers which are the strain at break, the elasticity modulus and the rupture facture. These results permitted to situate these fibers, compared to the other textile fibers, as materials that can be used in technical applications such as reinforcing composites or geotextile. In order to understand the mechanical properties of these fibers, a correlation study between the properties already cited and the fine structure was done. The obtained results showed that the mechanical properties of Agave americana L. fibers are closely related to the individual fibers deformations and to the natural matrix (lignin and gums) that are linked to these elementary fibers.

898,"A fracture is a clinical manifestation of osteoporosis and is one of the main causes of functional limitations and chronic pain in patients with osteoporosis. Muscle and coordination training are recommended to the patients as general measures. We inquired whether sling training is better than traditional physiotherapy in relieving pain and improving abilities of daily living. Fifty patients with osteoporosis were divided into two groups. Group A performed conventional physiotherapy, while Group B performed sling training exercises. Data were collected before and after the intervention and after 3 months. The registered parameters were stamina, posture, and pain. Posture, torques, and the associated strength of spinal muscles were studied in a biomechanical model in order to estimate the forces acting on the spine. Furthermore, the factors that exerted a positive impact on the success of therapy were registered. Forty-four patients (88%) completed the study. Positive effects of the training were noted in both groups, but significantly better effects were observed in the group that performed sling training. A reduction of pain independent of the number of fractures, significantly reduced torques, and reduced muscle strength were registered. Specific training programs helped to increase muscle strength and straightening the back thereby reducing the force needed on a permanent basis and decreasing torque in the spine. Sling training was more effective in that than traditional physiotherapy.

899,"As an emerging technology, the photovoltaic/concentrated solar power (PV-CSP) hybrid technology is considered as one of the research focuses currently in solar energy field, due to various advantages compared with the PV-alone and CSP-alone technologies. Compared with the PV-alone system, the PV-CSP hybrid system can produce electricity with better power quality. While compared with the CSP-alone system, the cost of power production can be reduced. The overall generating efficiency will also be greatly improved if the PV component and the CSP component of the hybrid system are ""compactly"" hybridized by PV-topping or spectral beam splitting (SBS) technologies. The development of PV-CSP hybrid systems accelerated in recent years with the increase of maturity of PV and CSP technologies. This paper presents an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art of the PV-CSP hybrid technologies, including the non-compact hybrid system, the PV-topping hybrid system, the SBS hybrid system, and the hybrid system combining SBS and PV-topping technologies. Recent progresses of the key technologies of the PV-CSP hybrid systems, such as high temperature solar cells, spectral beam filters, and high flux heat exchangers, are generally discussed. After that, the research status and the hybrid system performance are summarized from the literature to provide a global point of view on the PV-CSP hybrid technology. The advantages and limitations of the hybrid technology are also concluded according to the literature reviewed.

900,"1. How and at what spatial scale(s) animals change their movements in relation to their environment is central to several topics in ecology and conservation, including foraging ecology, habitat selection and dispersal. A method (first-passage time analysis, FPT) has recently been proposed to measure changes in movements through the landscape, as an index of search effort at the pertinent spatial scales. This method seems largely applicable to an increasing number of studies using satellite, radio-tracking or global positioning system (GPS), but its limits have not yet been assessed. 2. Here I used several movement simulations to examine the ability of FPT analysis to detect area-restricted search (ARS) according to different changes in movements, different patch structures and tracking accuracy. 3. FPT analysis was able to detect changes in movements when both speed and sinuosity changed, or when the animal reacted to patch boundaries. It was also able to detect ARS within the same path at several spatial scales in patches (nested or not) of different sizes. 4. Tracking accuracy affected the detection of ARS by FPT analysis. With the widely used Argos system, a minimum of 13 locations in effective ARS was necessary to detect this behaviour; seven when velocity filtering was applied. Similarly, spatial error in location affected the estimation of the ARS scale value, but the application of velocity filtering reduced this effect. 5. Comparisons between a real GPS track and pathways simulating the Argos error showed that the time-sampling rate of locations (due to satellite-pass frequency) decreased the probability of detecting ARS at small scales (50% across the whole range of scales. A velocity filter enabled significant reductions in this effect. 6. Synthesis and application. Within limits, FPT analysis is highly suitable for animal movement analysis, either to quantify habitat use, or to determine the scale most relevant for describing an ecological system or factors affecting movement decisions. In anticipation of increasing applications of FPT analysis in applied ecology, I provide recommendations for the use of the technique with several tracking methods.

901,"A subtype of microglia is defined by the morphological appearance of the cells as rod shaped. Little is known about this intriguing cell type, as there are only a few case reports describing rod-shaped microglia in the neuropathological literature. Rod-shaped microglia were shown recently to account for a substantial proportion of the microglia cells in the hippocampus of both demented and cognitively intact aged individuals. We hypothesized that aging could be a defining feature in the occurrence of rodshaped microglia. To test this hypothesis, 2 independent series of autopsy cases (total n 168 cases), which covered the adult lifespan from 20 to 100_ years old, were included in the study. The presence or absence of rod-shaped microglia was scored on IBA1 immunohistochemically stained slides for the hippocampus and cortex. We found that age was one of the strongest determinants for the presence of rod-shaped microglia in the hippocampus and the cortex. We found no association with the presence of rod-shaped microglia and a self-reported history of a TBI. Alzheimer's diseaseerelated pathology was found to influence the presence of rod-shaped microglia, but only in the parietal cortex and not in the hippocampus or temporal cortex. Future studies are warranted to determine the functional relevance of rod-shaped microglia in supporting the health of neurons in the aged brain, and the signaling processes that regulate the formation of rod-shaped microglia.

The aim is to identify and examine the main indoor pollutants which affect schoolchildren's health. The households were divided into two groups: 1) Group A, households with apparently unhealthy children, 2) Group B, households with healthy children. The findings for autumn and winter indicated that the differences in temperature and relative humidity (RH) between Groups A and B were not significant. The average concentrations of CO2, HCHO and acetaldehyde of Group A were lower than those of Group B. However, the average concentrations of PM2.5 and TVOCs of Group A were higher than those of Group B. In addition, the indoor PM2.5 concentrations in ten households, exceeded the upper limit of the Chinese national standard (75 mu g/m(3)) and the TVOCs concentration in two households exceeded the upper limit (600 mu g/m(3)) in winter. The average concentrations of Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) and Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP) which could harm children's health were significantly higher in the Group A household than those in that of Group B. Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Penicillium in indoor air and house dust which could have lead to children's allergy and respiratory diseases correlated with the seasonal climate variation. It was found that high-level indoor PM2.5, TVOCs, DEHP and DBP in house dust were possibly the main risk factors for children's health, with Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Penicillium possibly providing associated health risks.

The algorithm searches for the position of a text symbol in randomly generated 3-D matrix and subsequently replaces the symbol.

Further, the substituted positions are diffused so that all the cipher text get affected even if a single symbol is changed. The system uses a Logistic map for matrix generation and position shuffling. The algorithm also checks the integrity of cipher text by including its parity in encrypted form. As the system includes substitution, permutation and diffusion, high level of cryptographic complexity is achieved in cipher text. The proposed method is key sensitive output cipher text is random in nature and has avalanche effect. The key length chosen is sufficient to resist a brute force attack.

905,"A nanocomposite electrical generator composed of Zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs) was modeled using continuum mechanics and Maxwell's equations. Axial loading was considered and the optimum aspect ratio of ZnO NWs for getting to maximum electric potential was calculated. The bonding between the ZnO NWs and the polymer matrix was considered to be perfect and the linear piezoelectric behavior was assumed. It was shown that the electric potential has maximum and minimum values of opposite signs at the extreme ends along the nanowire length. The maximum generated electric potential varies from 0.01717 for a NW with an aspect ratio of one to 0.61107 for a NW with an aspect ratio of thirty. The optimum aspect ratio of ZnO NW was defined as the difference between the maximum generated electric potential at which the difference becomes less than 1%, which results in an aspect ratio of 16. The results are a major step toward producing ZnO NWs for nanocomposite electrical generators with maximum performance.

The system runs under control of an open-source microcontroller. The main operational parameters were optimized. Given the particular kinetics of the reaction, a stopped-flow period (1 or 5 min) was included to allow for color development. The method presents linearity in the range 0.35-3.0 mg L-1, good precision (s(r) <3%), and detection and quantification limits of 0.10 and 0.35 mg L-1 respectively. Samples of tap water or eye drops could be successfully analyzed employing a 1-minute stop time, providing a maximum sampling frequency of 32 samples h(-1).

TRX is induced by various oxidative stress factors, including ultraviolet rays, radiation, oxidation, viral infections, ischemia reperfusion and anticancer agents, and are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases. We have demonstrated that systemic administration and transgenic overexpression of TRX is effective in a wide variety of in vivo inflammatory disease models, such as viral pneumonia, acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indomethacin-induced gastric injury, and dermatitis. Our recent studies indicate that topically applied TRX prevents skin inflammation via the inhibition of local formation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These indicate that the activation of inflammasome in skin and mucosa may be regulated by TRX. These suggest that application of TRX may be useful for the treatment of various skin and mucosal inflammatory disorders. Based on these results, we are conducting clinical studies to develop human recombinant thioredoxin 1 (rhTRX) pharmaceuticals. We have also developed substances that increase the expression of TRX in the body (TRX-inducing substances) in vegetables and other plant ingredients, and we are also developing skin-care products and functional foods that take advantage of the anti-inflammation and anti-allergic action of TRX.

911,"Agriculture intensification through the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers is contributing substantially to the tremendous increases in global food production. However, eutrophication of downstream waters associated with excess nitrate pollutant runoff has become a major environmental concern in agricultural areas. Reservoirs used for irrigation are well-positioned to intercept substantial fertilizer runoff from upslope agricultural fields. The authors hypothesized that such reservoirs can be used to influence the quality of downstream surface water. A Markov decision process was formulated to find optimal operating policies for controlling stochastic agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation. The model was applied to an irrigation reservoir in Japan that is prone to nitrate pollution from upslope green tea plantations. The computational results reveal that, in all nitrate-nitrogen states in which the reservoir storage state is below 10%, the optimal policy is to introduce cleaner water supplements from the upstream reservoir. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate-nitrogen concentration is less than 3 mg/L, the optimal policy would be only to release the irrigation water. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 mg/L, the optimal operation decision is to first release irrigation water from the reservoir before introducing cleaner water supplements. Therefore, the operation of irrigation reservoirs can be optimized to control intercepted agro-fertilizer pollutants from intensive agricultural areas. The developed method for reservoir irrigation operation has the potential to support decision making processes to provide greater protection of the water environment from agrochemical pollution while sustaining the productivity in the intensive agricultural areas.

The mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and microglia cell model of oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) were made. The expression of SNHG14, miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A protein expression was determined by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively. Dual-luciferase assay was used to verify the direct binding of miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A. Flow cytometry was applied to measure neurons' apoptosis. SNHG14 highly expressed in ischemic cerebral tissues and BV-2 cells after OGD treatment. SNHG14 knockdown could remarkably inhibit BV-2 cells activation induced by OGD; while SNHG14 overexpression significantly promoted BV-2 cells activation, showing an increase of TNF-alpha and NO production and neurons' apoptosis rate. Additionally, SNHG14 knockdown promoted the expression of miR-145-5p and reduced PLA2G4A. Contrarily, SNHG14 overexpression inhibited miR-145-5p expression and increased PLA2G4A. Moreover, miR-145-5p overexpression also reversed the effect of OGD on BV-2 cells activation.

More specifically, STW-KNN considers the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features, to optimize the search mechanisms containing state vector, proximity measure, prediction function, and K selection. Furthermore, STW-KNN is implemented on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform with the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm, for parallel prediction of traffic flow in real time. Finally, with extensive experiments on real-world big taxi trajectory data, STW-KNN is compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models including conventional K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and C4.5.

In this scheme, Alice and Bob adopt two independent random sequences to control the phase modulators of CSLSs, which induces a dynamic perturbation to the chaos synchronization. We thoroughly investigate the chaos synchronization performance under different phase-shift conditions with cross-correlation function, and systematically discuss the feasibility and security of the system. The results show that, with proper injection and feedback strength, the correlation coefficient gap between phase shift match and mismatch is clear and robust to the parameter mismatches in the CSLSs and those between the two CSLSs. Based on this, high-quality key distribution can be performed by picking out the identical random bits from the two independent random sequences according to the computational correlation. Moreover, the investigations on the information theoretic security and rate of the key distribution show that the security of the key distribution scheme can be further enhanced by properly increasing the number of layers in the CSLSs or employing highorder modulation format.

Taizhou Bridge, the longest triple-tower suspension bridge in the world, is then taken as an example for this investigation. A three-dimensional finite element model of the bridge is established in ABAQUS, and the LANCZOS eigenvalue solver is employed to calculate the structural dynamic characteristics. Traveling wave effect on seismic responses of these long-span triple-tower suspension bridges is investigated. Envelopes of seismic shear force and moment in the longitudinal direction along the three towers, relative displacements between the towers and the girder, and reaction forces at the bottoms of the three towers under different apparent wave velocities are calculated and presented in detail. The results show that the effect of apparent wave velocity on the seismic responses of triple-tower suspension bridge fluctuates when the velocity is lower than 2000 m/s, and the effects turn stable when the velocity becomes larger. In addition, the effects of traveling wave are closely related to spectral characteristics and propagation direction of the seismic wave, and seismic responses of components closer to the source are relatively larger. Therefore, reliable estimation of the seismic input and apparent wave velocity according to the characteristics of the bridge site are significant for accurate prediction of seismic responses. This study provides critical reference for seismic analysis and design of long-span triple-tower suspension bridges.

925,"A gold nanoparticle probe-based assay (GNPA) was developed for ultrasensitive detection of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen. In the GNPA, after anti-HCV core antigen polyclonal antibodies and single stranded barcode signal DNA were labeled on gold nanoparticle probe (NP), DNA enzyme was used to degrade the unbound barcode DNA5. The anti-HCV core antigen monoclonal antibodies were coated on magnetic microparticles probe (MMP). Then the NP-HCV core antigen-MMP sandwich immunocomplex was formed when the target antigen protein was added and captured. Magnetically separated, the immuno-complex containing the single-stranded barcode signal DNA was characterized by TagMan probe based real-time fluorescence PCR. A detection limit of 1 fg/ml was determined for the HCV core antigen which is magnitude greater than that of ELISA (2 ng/ml). The coefficients of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay respectively ranged from 0.22-2.62% and 1.92-3.01%. The improved GNPA decreased the interference of unbound barcode DNAs and may be an new way for HCV core antigen detection. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

926,"Adsorption processes are responsible for detection of cancer biomarkers in biosensors (and immunosensors), which can be captured with various principles of detection. In this study, we used a biosensor made with nanostructured films of polypyrrole and p53 antibodies, and image analysis of scanning electron microscopy data made it possible to correlate morphological changes of the biosensor with the concentration of cells containing the cancer biomarker p53. The selectivity of the biosensor was proven by distinguishing images obtained with exposure of the biosensor to cells containing the biomarker from those acquired with cells that did not contain it. Detection was confirmed with cyclic voltammetry measurements, while the adsorption of the p53 biomarker was probed with polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption (PM-IRRAS) and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Adsorption is described using the Langmuir-Freundlich model, with saturation taking place at a concentration of 100 Ucells/mL. Taken together, our results point to novel ways to detect biomarkers or any type of analyte for which detection is based on adsorption as is the case of the majority of biosensors.

The aims of this study were to describe baseline characteristics and evolution of a cohort of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treated with ustekinumab and to compare differences between patients who discontinued treatment and those who maintained. A retrospective multicenter observational study including patients who had received ustekinumab for a minimum of 3 months from 2009 to 2015 was performed. The baseline characteristics of the cohort of patients, the main indication for treatment, number and percentage of patients who maintained and discontinued treatment, reasons for discontinuation and differences between patients who discontinued and maintained ustekinumab were evaluated. Fifty-eight patients were included. The main indication was dermatological (72.4% of cases), and treatment with ustekinumab was maintained in most patients (62.1% of cases) with low discontinuation by side effects and rheumatological lack of efficacy. Discontinuation of ustekinumab was correlated with more number of obese patients, less presence of plaque psoriasis and more number of previous biological therapies. Ustekinumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in the management of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in daily clinical practice in our cohort of patients.

He was consistently DNA positive but took 2 years to fully seroconvert. Sequencing of the HTLV-II strain in his cultured T lymphocytes indicated that it is a prototypical type A strain with no major differences in the long terminal repeat DNA sequence, nor major amino acid differences in the Gag, Env, Tax, and Rex proteins. However, a mutation in its pol gene created a stop codon at amino acid 543 of the Pol protein, a region that encodes for the RNase function. This mutation may account for the subject's slow seroconversion.

929,"Acrylates have been widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceutical polymers. The quantitation of residual acrylate monomers is vital as they are strong irritants and allergens, but after polymerization, are relatively inert, causing no irritation and allergies. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) hydrogels were prepared using pentaerythritol tetra-acrylate (PETRA) as UV crosslinking agent. A simple, accurate, and robust quantitation method was developed based on gas chromatographic techniques (GC), which is suitable for routine analysis of residual PETRA monomers in these hydrogels. Unreacted PETRA was initially identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). The quantitation of analyte was performed and validated using gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC FID). A linear relationship was obtained over the range of 0.0002%-0.0450% (m/m) with a correlation coefficient (r(2)) greater than 0.99. The recovery (>90%), intra-day precision (%RSD <0.67), inter-day precision (%RSD <2.5%), and robustness (%RSD <1.62%) of the method were within the acceptable values. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 0.0001% (m/m) and 0.0002% (m/m), respectively.

930,"3D mesh segmentation is considered an important process in the field of computer graphics. It is a fundamental process in different applications such as shape reconstruction in reverse engineering, 3D models retrieval, and CAD/CAM applications, etc. It consists of subdividing a polygonal surface into patches of uniform properties either from a geometrical point of view or from a perceptual/semantic point of view. In this paper, unsupervised clustering techniques for the 3D mesh segmentation problem are introduced. The K-means and the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering techniques are selected for the development of the proposed clustering-based 3D mesh segmentation techniques. Since the mesh faces are considered the main element, the clustering technique is applied to the dual mesh. The 3D Euclidean distance is used as the distance measure to compute matching between mesh elements. Based on empirical results on a benchmark dataset of 3D mesh models, the FCM-based mesh segmentation technique outperforms the K-means-based one in terms of accuracy and consistency with human segmentations.

Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass lesion with heterogeneous density measuring 2.2 cm in diameter located between the second segment of the duodenum and uncinate process of the pancreas. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no remarkable findings in the remnant stomach; however, the scope could not reach the duodenum due to altered anatomy by Roux-en-Y reconstruction after the distal gastrectomy. The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass lesion under the clinical diagnosis of MALT lymphoma relapse. An orange calculus was apparent in the thinly extended duodenal wall on stretching, and the hall was closed by meticulous primary suture after the duodenal resection. Macroscopically, the extracted calculus was solid and quite hard, measured 2.2 x 2.1 x 2.1 cm, and the cut surface revealed a layered structure in the outer areas with granulated contents in the center. Although duodenal diverticula are relatively common, an enterolith developing within a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum is rare, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case due to altered anatomy after gastrectomy reported in the English literature.

935,"Advancement in information technology is playing an increasing role in the use of information systems comprising relational databases. These databases are used effectively in collaborative environments for information extraction; consequently, they are vulnerable to security threats concerning ownership rights and data tampering. Watermarking is advocated to enforce ownership rights over shared relational data and for providing a means for tackling data tampering. When ownership rights are enforced using watermarking, the underlying data undergoes certain modifications; as a result of which, the data quality gets compromised. Reversible watermarking is employed to ensure data quality along-with data recovery. However, such techniques are usually not robust against malicious attacks and do not provide any mechanism to selectively watermark a particular attribute by taking into account its role in knowledge discovery. Therefore, reversible watermarking is required that ensures; (i) watermark encoding and decoding by accounting for the role of all the features in knowledge discovery; and, (ii) original data recovery in the presence of active malicious attacks. In this paper, a robust and semi-blind reversible watermarking (RRW) technique for numerical relational data has been proposed that addresses the above objectives. Experimental studies prove the effectiveness of RRW against malicious attacks and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing ones.

936,"A new approach for solar electricity generation and storage is proposed, based on the concept of thermally regenerative batteries. Concentrated sunlight is used for external thermo-chemical charging of a flow battery, and electricity is produced by conventional electro-chemical discharge of the battery. The battery replaces the steam turbine, currently used in commercial concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, potentially leading to much higher conversion efficiency. This approach offers potential performance, cost and operational advantages compared to existing solar technologies, and to existing storage solutions for management of an electrical grid with a significant contribution of intermittent solar electricity generation. Here we analyze the theoretical conversion efficiency for new thermo-electro-chemical storage (TECS) plant schemes based on the electro-chemical systems of sodium-sulfur (Na-S) and zinc-air. The thermodynamic upper limit of solar to electricity conversion efficiency for an ideal TECS cycle is about 60% for Na-S at reactor temperature of 1550 K, and 65% for the zinc-air system at 1750 K, both under sunlight concentration of 3000. A hybrid process with carbothermic reduction in the zinc-air system reaches 60% theoretical efficiency at the more practical conditions of reaction temperature <1200 K and concentration <1000. Practical TECS plant efficiency, estimated from these upper limits, may then be much higher compared to existing solar electricity technologies. The technical and economical feasibility of the proposed cycle are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of the study was to report our experience with STC for UC in a single large centre. Method From January 2007 to May 2015, all consecutive patients undergoing STC for UC were retrospectively analysed from a prospectively managed database. Patients with known Crohn's disease or those undergoing one-stage procedures were excluded. Demographics, perioperative outcomes and second-stage procedures were analysed. Results During the study period, 151 STCs were performed for UC [100 emergency (66%) and 51 elective (34%)]. Acute severe colitis refractory to therapy was the most common indication (62%). Overall, 117 laparoscopic (78%) and 34 open STCs were performed, with a conversion rate of 14.5%. Mortality and morbidity rates were 0.7% and 38%, respectively. Whilst operative time was shorter for open STC (by 75 min; P = 0.001), there were fewer complications (32% vs 62%; P = 0.002) and a shorter hospital stay (by 6.9 days; P = 0.0002) following laparoscopic STC. Fewer complications and shorter hospital stay were also observed after elective STC. Patients undergoing laparoscopic STC were more likely to undergo a restorative second-stage procedure than those having open STC (75% vs 50%; P = 0.03). Conclusion Laparoscopic STC for UC is feasible and safe, even in the emergency situation. A laparoscopic approach may offer advantages in terms of lower morbidity and reduced length of stay. Elective resection may offer similar advantages and is best performed whenever possible.

940,"A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the widely-used herbicide Atrazine (ATR) can cause injury to dopamine (DA) neurons, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of lactational ATR exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats on dopaminergic neuron health later in life. Compared with control rats, rats exposed to ATR during a critical period of neural development showed decreased striatal DA content and increased rates of DA turnover. The expression of Monoamine oxidase (MAO), which is associated with DA degradation, was up-regulated, and the expression of Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is associated with DA transport, was down-regulated. The expression of transcription factor Nuclear Receptor Related Factor 1 (Nurr1), which is associated with DA neuron development, was down-regulated. Increased age (6-12 months old) increased the statistical significance of the differences of the above indicators in the ATR-treated rats compared to the control rats (P < 0.05). Taken together, our results indicate that ATR exposure during the critical neural development period causes a down-regulation of Nurr1, which in turn affects Nurr1 target genes, including MAO, VMAT2 and DAT, which are involved in DA degradation and transport. Reduced expression of these genes impairs the capacity for vesicular storage or reuptake of DA, causing decreased levels of striatal DA, which can ultimately lead to DA neuron injury. DA neuron injuries become more severe over time, which suggests that aging can synergistically promote the ATR-associated DA neuron injuries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

941,"A lot of work has taken place into the design and control of DC-DC converters, and various methodologies have been proposed. While traditionally only P or PI controllers have been employed, recent applications that require a fast transient performance impose the usage of the derivative, D, term. As it is well known, using the D-term can cause numerous problems in such converters that greatly downgrade their performance and lifetime. Having said that, in this paper, we first prove that by using the D-term, it is possible to increase the stability margin (and hence keep a low current ripple), and then, we present a novel method to tune the PID controller that guarantees a fast and stable response over a wide range of parameter values without using an unreasonably high value of the derivative gain that magnifies the presence of noise in the system. The controller is designed utilising Filippov's method, and a simple and easy to implement strategy is proposed. Furthermore, an adaptive PID controller is designed whose gains are changed depending on the value of the supply voltage or output load. Another important contribution of this work is the derivation of the saltation matrix when the switching manifold is discontinuous, the complete proof is presented, and the results validated.

Furthermore, BBT/TiO2 heterojunction is conveniently fabricated through an in-situ polycondensation procedure of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene in the presence of commercial TiO2.

Indeed, human behavior understanding plays a fundamental role in several innovative application domains such as smart video surveillance, ambient intelligence and content-based video information retrieval. However, the uncertainty and vagueness that typically characterize human daily activities make frameworks for human behavior analysis (HBA) hard to design and develop. In order to bridge this gap, this paper proposes a hierarchical architecture, based on a tracking algorithm, time-delay neural networks and fuzzy inference systems, aimed at improving the performance of current MBA systems in terms of scalability, robustness and effectiveness in behavior detection. Precisely, the joint use of the aforementioned methodologies enables both a quantitative and qualitative behavioral analysis that efficiently face the intrinsic people/objects tracking imprecision and provide context aware and semantic capabilities for better identifying a given activity. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework have been verified by using the well-known CAVIAR dataset and comparing our system's performance with other similar approaches working on the same dataset.

The mixture of experts model is a powerful model which probabilistically splits the input space allowing different models to operate in the separate regions. However, current methods have no fail-safe against outliers. In this paper, a robust mixture of experts model is proposed which consists of Student-t mixture models at the gates and Student-t distributed experts, trained via Bayesian inference. The Student-t distribution has heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution, and so it is more robust to outliers, noise and non normality in the data. Using both simulated data and real data obtained from the Z24 bridge this robust mixture of experts performs better than its Gaussian counterpart when outliers are present. In particular, it provides robustness to outliers in two forms: unbiased parameter regression models, and robustness to overfitting/complex models.

A protocol was designed to allow for a rigorous, yet pragmatic evaluation of a 12-week INR follow-up interval. Feasibility was determined by study enrollment, retention, and participant achievement rates for the extended INR interval. Safety was determined by bleeding and thromboembolism rates. Participants were monitored for 6 months. Despite the long-term stability of participants prior to enrollment, only 56% achieved a 12-week follow-up interval and only 34% of enrolled participants maintained a 12-week interval. Sixteen percent of participants were never eligible for an extension of their INR follow-up interval despite meeting initial enrollment criteria.

Main reproductive parameters including first pregnancy time, first brood time, the number of first brood and total fecundity after 21 d exposures at the same concentrations of pesticides as described above were also measured. The results showed that the activities of GST increased in lower concentrations and decreased in higher concentrations after 24 h exposure to three pesticides, respectively. The activities of SOD showed the same changes after 48 h exposure. With the time prolonged, the activities of GST decreased while the activities of SOD increased. After 21 d exposure, the first pregnancy time and first brood time were delayed, while the number of the first brood and total fecundity per female decreased with increasing concentrations. These results corroborated that GST activity was more sensitive to those pesticides than SOD activity, and there was a significant relationship between total fecundity and pesticides-dose(r>0.94, n=6), GST activity after 48 h exposure and total fecundity after 21 d exposure (r>0.92, n=6).

The MRE specimens were cured in an anisotropic mold, which could be used to induce a uniaxial magnetic field via permanent magnets, to control the orientation of the CIP, and the shear modulus of the MREs was evaluated under a magnetic field induced by using a magnetic flux generator (MFG). Because the use of a conventional evaluation system to determine the magnetic-field-dependent shear modulus of the MREs was difficult, an evaluation system based on single degree-of-freedom vibration and electromagnetics that included an MFG, which is a device that generates a magnetic field via a variable induced current, was designed. An electromagnetic finite element method (FEM) analysis and design of experiments (DoE) techniques were employed to optimize the magnetic flux density generated by the MFG. The optimized system was verified over the range to determine the magnetic flux density generated by the MFG in order to use a magnetic circuit analysis to identify the existence of magnetic saturation. A variation in the shear modulus was observed with increasing CIP volume fraction and induced current. The experimental results revealed that the maximum variation in the shear modulus was 76.3% for 40 vol% CIP at an induced current of 4 A. With these results, the appropriate CIP volume fraction, induced current, and design procedure of the MFG can be proposed as guidelines for applications of MREs based on natural rubber.

957,"A Pelton-wheel impulse turbine is a hydro mechanical energy conversion device which converts gravitational energy of elevated water into mechanical work. This mechanical work is converted into electrical energy by means of running an electrical generator The kinetic energy of the Water-jet is directed tangentially at the buckets of a Pelton-wheel. The Water-jet strikes on each bucket's convex profile splitter and get split into two halves. Each half is turned backwards, almost through 180 degrees relative to the bucket on a horizontal plane. Practically this angle may vary between 165 degrees to 170 degrees. Normally all the jet energy is used in propelling the rim of the bucket wheel. Invariably some jet water misses the bucket and posses onto the tail race without doing any useful work. This hydro, device is a good source of hydro-electrical energy conversion for a high water head. The present work in this research paper deals with some advanced modifications in the conventional Pelton-wheel so that it can be used for low-head and heavy-discharge applications. Both kinetic and potential energy of the water source is consumed by the runner wheel. Considerable gravitational effect of the water jet is exploited by means of some modifications in a conventional Pelton-wheel. A comparatively heavy generator can be run by this modified Pelton-wheel turbine under low-head and heavy-discharge conditions. The modified features provide enough promising opportunities to use this turbine for Mini and Micro hydro power plants.

958,"A high-order curvature-compensated bandgap reference (BGR) with low temperature coefficient (TC) is proposed in this paper. The curvature compensation is maintained through the use of Pplus poly resistor and Nplus poly resistor to achieve temperature-dependent resistor ratios. A T-resistor structure is adopted which enables the BGR to work under low supply voltage or high MOSFET threshold voltage and to reduce the mismatches in transistors and resistors. The design is implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology with a 1.8-V supply. The output reference voltage is 550 mV and shows a TC of 0.22 ppm/degrees C in a temperature range from -20 degrees C to 80 degrees C. A high gain operational amplifier is used that enhances the power supply rejection ratio to -117.8 dB at DC and -75 dB at 1 kHz. The effect of mismatch is 4.3%. The proposed BGR achieves a line regulation of 0.8 mV/V and total power consumption of 20.8 mu W.

959,"A Shannon cipher system for memoryless sources in which distortion is allowed at the legitimate decoder is considered. The source is compressed using a secured rate distortion code, which satisfies a constraint on the compression rate, as well as a constraint on the exponential rate of the excess-distortion probability at the legitimate decoder. Secrecy is measured by the exponential rate of the exiguous-distortion probability at the eavesdropper, rather than by the traditional measure of equivocation. The perfect-secrecy exponent is defined as the maximal exiguous-distortion exponent achievable when the key rate is unlimited. The reproduction-based estimate exponent is defined as the maximal exiguous-distortion exponent achievable for a genie-aided eavesdropper, which knows the secret key. Under limited key rate, it is proved that the maximal achievable exiguous-distortion exponent is equal to the minimum between the key rate plus the reproduction-based estimate exponent, and the perfect-secrecy exponent. The result is generalized to a fairly general class of variable key-rate and coding-rate codes.

We tried to investigate whether there is a relationship between hemodynamic, ECG and HR changes after dipyridamole infusion and gated myocardial perfusion SPECT findings. We studied 206 consecutive patients which underwent a 2-day protocol Dipyridamole Stress/Rest Tc99m-Sestamibi gated myocardial perfusion SPECT. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HR and ECG were recorded. HR was mildly increased while SBP and DBP were mildly decreased after Dipyridamole infusion. There was only statistically significant difference between ECG changes as well as transient ischemic dilation (TID) ratio between normal scans and scans with ischemia (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01 respectively). There was correlation between these variables and summed stress score (SSS) and summed difference score (SDS). Patients with ischemia in their scans, 44.3% had ST depression after Dipyridamole infusion. Also ST depression most frequently was seen in patients with left anterior descending artery disease. From patients with abnormal scan + ST depression after Dipyridamole infusion (33 patient), 27 patient (81.81%) had ischemia. There was an association between TID ratio as well as ECG changes after Dipyridamole infusion and SSS, SDS and coronary artery territory abnormality. Difference between calculated left ventricular ejection fraction using stress and rest images had significant correlation with SSS and SDS. ST depression after Dipyridamole infusion and TID ratio had association with ischemia, SSS and SDS. So in equivocal Gated SPECT findings, they could be very useful for interpretation.

961,"A novel dual Halbach array is proposed in this paper to increase the output performance of tubular linear machines. The magnetic field distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space is formulated with Bessel functions analytically. Following that, the modeling of force output for linear machines with three-phase windings is carried out based on Lorentz force law. The formula component of force ripple is separated from the analytical expression of total force. It is found that for multi-phase tubular linear machines, the force output and force ripple are not only closely related to the instantaneous position of the mover, but also the starting position. Therefore, the force output of the linear machine is formulated for three typical starting positions as a function of mover positions. The derived models are simulated with respect to the mover's motion. They are also validated with numerical results from finite element calculation. The study shows that an appropriate starting position of the mover helps to improve the output performance of the tubular linear machines. The proposed analytical force model can also be employed to analyze the influence of the structure parameters on the force output of linear machines with similar structures.

The molecular characterization of NIS in 1996 and the use of radioactive I- isotopes have led to significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer and provide the molecular basis for studies aimed at extending the use of radioiodide treatment in extrathyroidal malignancies.

963,"Among several promising new drug-delivery systems, liposomes represent an advanced technology to deliver active molecules to the site of action, and at present several formulations are in clinical use. Research on liposome technology has progressed from conventional vesicles (""first-generation liposomes"") to ""second-generation liposomes"", in which long-circulating liposomes are obtained by modulating the lipid composition, size, and charge of the vesicle. Liposomes with modified surfaces have also been developed using several molecules, such as glycolipids or sialic acid. A significant step in the development of long-circulating liposomes came with inclusion of the synthetic polymer poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in liposome composition. The presence of PEG on the surface of the liposomal carrier has been shown to extend blood-circulation time while reducing mononuclear phagocyte system uptake (stealth liposomes). This technology has resulted in a large number of liposome formulations encapsulating active molecules, with high target efficiency and activity. Further, by synthetic modification of the terminal PEG molecule, stealth liposomes can be actively targeted with monoclonal antibodies or ligands. This review focuses on stealth technology and summarizes pre-clinical and clinical data relating to the principal liposome formulations; it also discusses emerging trends of this promising technology.

964,"Accurate and high resolution bathymetric data is a necessity for a wide range of coastal oceanographic research topics. Active sensing methods, such as ship-based soundings and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), are expensive and time consuming solutions. Therefore, the significance of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has increased in the last ten years due to the availability of multi-constellation, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution remote sensing data as Open Data. Effective SDB algorithms have been proposed by many authors, but there is no ready-to-use software module available in the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment as yet. Hence, this study implements a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based SDB workflow as a Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS module (i.image.bathymetry). Several case studies were carried out to examine the performance of the module in multi-constellation and multi-resolution satellite imageries for different study areas. The results indicate a strong correlation between SDB and reference depth. For instance, case study 1 (Puerto Rico, Northeastern Caribbean Sea) has shown an coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98 and an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 m, case study 2 (Iwate, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 1.50 m, and case study 3 (Miyagi, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.93 and an RMSE of 1.65 m. The reference depths were acquired by using LiDAR for case study 1 and an echo-sounder for case studies 2 and 3. Further, the estimated SDB has been used as one of the inputs for the Australian National University and Geoscience Australia (ANUGA) tsunami simulation model. The tsunami simulation results also show close agreement with post-tsunami survey data. The i.mage.bathymetry module developed as a part of this study is made available as an extension for the Open Source GRASS GIS to facilitate wide use and future improvements.

METHODS Multiple MRI techniques were used to assess cerebral changes in 20 quiescent CD patients with fatigue (defined with at least 6 points out of an 11-point numeric rating scale compared with 17 healthy age and gender matched controls without fatigue. Furthermore, mental status was assessed by cognitive functioning, based on the neuropsychological inventory including the different domains global cognitive functioning, memory and executive functioning and in addition mood and quality of life scores. Cognitive functioning and mood status were correlated with MRI findings in the both study groups. RESULTS Reduced glutamate + glutamine (Glx = Glu + Gln) concentrations (P = 0.02) and ratios to total creatine (P = 0.02) were found in CD patients compared with controls. Significant increased Cerebral Blood Flow (P = 0.05) was found in CD patients (53.08 +/- 6.14 mL/100 g/min) compared with controls (47.60 +/- 8.62 mL/100 g/min). CD patients encountered significantly more depressive symptoms (P < 0.001). Cognitive functioning scores related to memory (P = 0.007) and executive functioning (P = 0.02) were lower in CD patients and both scores showed correlation with depression and anxiety. No correlation was found subcortical volumes between CD patients and controls in the T1-weighted analysis. In addition, no correlation was found between mental status and MRI findings. CONCLUSION This work shows evidence for perfusion, neurochemical and mental differences in the brain of CD patients with fatigue compared with healthy controls.

967,"3D finite-element (FE) mesh generation is a major hurdle for marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modeling. In this paper, we present a FE discretization operator (FEDO) that automatically converts a 3D finite difference (FD) model into reliable and efficient tetrahedral FE meshes for CSEM modeling. FEDO sets up wireframes of a background seabed model that precisely honors the seafloor topography. The wireframes are then partitioned into multiple regions. Outer regions of the wireframes are discretized with coarse tetrahedral elements whose maximum size is as large as a skin depth of the regions. We demonstrate that such coarse meshes can produce accurate FE solutions because numerical dispersion errors of tetrahedral meshes do not accumulate but oscillates. In contrast, central regions of the wireframes are discretized with fine tetrahedral elements to describe complex geology in detail. The conductivity distribution is mapped from FD to FE meshes in a volume-averaged sense. To avoid excessive mesh refinement around receivers, we introduce an effective receiver size. Major advantages of FEDO are summarized as follow. First, FEDO automatically generates reliable and economic tetrahedral FE meshes without adaptive meshing or interactive CAD workflows. Second, FEDO produces FE meshes that precisely honor the boundaries of the seafloor topography. Third, FEDO derives multiple sets of FE meshes from a given FD model. Each FE mesh is optimized for a different set of sources and receivers and is fed to a subgroup of processors on a parallel computer. This divide and conquer approach improves the parallel scalability of the FE solution. Both accuracy and effectiveness of FEDO are demonstrated with various CSEM examples.

However, those patrol nodes' battery energy will consume rapidly and thus makes the whole WSN to have reduced lifetime.

969,"A new systematic approach to state of charge (Sac) observer design for battery cells is presented. It is based on a purely data driven model and a nonlinear observer constructed from it. As a key novelty, a unified and generic framework for model generation (i.e. design of experiments, nonlinear model structure) and observer parametrisation is presented. An integral part of SoC observers in hybrid electrical vehicles is a dynamic battery model which describes the nonlinear system behaviour of the cell terminal voltage. In order to enable the application of the proposed concepts for any type of battery chemistry, a data based modelling approach using the architecture of local model networks (LMNs) is proposed. As an important prerequisite, optimal model based experiment design ensures proper excitation of the system dynamics while the desired SoC operating range is covered. For SoC estimation, an augmented state space representation of the LMN is derived and the nonlinear observer design is presented. In particular, the use of a fuzzy observer is beneficial in combination with LMNs since the local observers are time-invariant which greatly reduces the complexity of the global estimator. The proposed concepts are validated experimentally by means of a Lithium Ion power cell. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

972,"An effective method based on measuring the fiber orientation of yarn floats with two-dimensional Fourier transform (2-D FFT) is proposed to recognize the weave pattern of yarn-dyed fabric in the high-resolution image. The recognition process consists of four main steps: 1. High-resolution image reduction, 2.Fabric image skew correction, 3.Yarn floats localization, 4. Yarn floats classification. Firstly, the high-resolution image is reduced by the nearest interpolation algorithm. Secondly, the skew of the fabric image is corrected based on Hough transform. Thirdly, the yarn floats in the fabric image is localized by the yarns segmentation method based on the mathematical statistics of sub-images. Fourthly, the high-resolution image is corrected and its yarns are segmented successively according to the inspection information of the reduced image. The fiber orientations are detected by 2-D FFT, and the yarn floats are classified by k-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results and discussions demonstrate that, by measuring the fiber orientation of yarn floats, the proposed method is effective to recognize the yarn floats and the weave pattern for yarn-dyed, solid color, and gray fabrics.

The potential for replacing tap water used in washing machines with rainwater was studied, and then analysis presented in this paper is valid for applications that include washing machines where tap water hardness may be important A wide range of weather conditions, such as rainfall (284-1794 mm/year); water hardness (14-315 mg/L CaCO3); tap water prices (0.85-2.65 Euros/m(3)) in different Spanish urban areas (from individual buildings to whole neighbourhoods); and other scenarios (including materials and water storage capacity) were analysed. Rainfall was essential for rainwater harvesting, but the tap water prices and the water hardness were the main factors for consideration in the financial and the environmental analyses, respectively. The local tap water hardness and prices can cause greater financial and environmental impacts than the type of material used for the water storage tank or the volume of the tank. The use of rainwater as a substitute for hard water in washing machines favours financial analysis. Although tap water hardness significantly affects the financial analysis, the greatest effect was found in the environmental analysis. When hard tap water needed to be replaced, it was found that a water price of 1 Euro/m(3) could render the use of rainwater financially feasible when using large-scale rainwater harvesting systems. When the water hardness was greater than 300 mg/L CaCO3, a financial analysis revealed that an net present value greater than 270 Euros/dwelling could be obtained at the neighbourhood scale, and there could be a reduction in the Global Warming Potential (100 years) ranging between 35 and 101 kg CO2 eq./dwelling/year.

979,"A significant energy loss results from the poor thermal insulations of the commercial and public buildings. Windows diffuse a large fraction of building heating and cooling energy to the external environment, representing an annual impact of 4.1 quadrillion British thermal unit of primary energy in the US. The current technology for efficient windows relies upon the double-pane insulated glass unit with an insulating gas in between. A key challenge is to reduce thermal conductivity of the windows without relying on insulating materials. The photothermal effect can be possibly utilized for particular functionalities that can collect solar energy for reducing heat loss. The insulation efficiency is quantified through the U-factor, defined as the ratio of the heat flux (H) per unit area through the pane to the difference (Delta T) between the window interior surface and exterior temperatures. Upon solar irradiation, single-panes can ""self-heat"" via the photothermal effect from the nanoparticle coatings. This can effectively reduce Delta T for enhanced thermal insulation. In this study, the photothermal effect on Fe3O4 nanoparticles stimulated by solar light was investigated for nanoparticles in solutions and as thin films for energy-efficient windows. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were surface-functionalized with different polymers to modulate colloidal stability and for the investigation of the photothermal effect. The photothermal heating efficiencies of Fe3O4 with different surface coatings were found to be much greater under the white-light irradiation than near infrared (NIR) in both aqueous suspension and as thin films. The mechanism for the photothermal effect of Fe3O4 was identified in terms of its band structure. Both Urbach energy and band gap were obtained based on absorption spectra of various Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Urbach ""tail"" was found consistent with nanoparticle surface defect structures, while the band gap (similar to 3.1 eV) corresponded to the electronic transitions in the octahedral site of Fe3O4. We also discuss the absorption based photonic physics responsible for the much-enhanced photothermal heating by white-light as compared with NIR. Based on the photothermal heating, the U-factors were obtained with the nanoparticle coatings that show promise in producing energy efficient windows.

986,"Arrays of sharp conical spike microstructures are created by repeatedly irradiating silicon surfaces with focused femtosecond laser pulses in SF6. The absorbance of light is increased to approximately 90% in a wavelength range from the near ultraviolet (0.25 mu m) to the near infrared (2.5 mu m) by the microstructured silicon surface. The microstructured surface presents pitch-black because of enhanced absorption with a broad wavelength range, which is called black silicon. The unique microstructure morphology of black silicon surface formed by femtosecond laser can also bring a lot of other surface functions, for example, self-cleaning and field emission. These functions make black silicon highly desirable in solar energy, detectors and other fields. Therefore, the forming mechanism and conditions of fabrication optimization for black silicon microstructure have always been the focus of research. In our work, the sample is moved by motor-controlled stage while the laser beam is fixed. In the case of laser beam scanning, arrays of sharp conical spikes on the silicon are manufactured in 70 kPa SF6. The aim of the experiment is to find how to optimize the distribution of the laser energy in a number of laser accumulation pulses (the combination of single pulse energy and pulse number) to control the surface morphology of the black silicon. Experimental results show that there appears a bottleneck effect of morphology size growth with the increase of laser irradiation (improving the single pulse energy or increasing pulse accumulation number). Excessive energy accumulation brings no extra effect on optimizing and controlling of microstructure morphology on the surface. Based on theoretical results obtained from a physical model we proposed, we find that the reason for this phenomenon is that the microstructure morphology induced by former sequence pulse modulates the laser energy absorption of current laser pulse, and changes the laser ablation efficiency of the current pulse. According to this physical mechanism, we propose a new way of optimizing surface morphology, with fixing the total laser irradiation energy. And the size and distribution of surface morphology can be achieved by optimizing the distribution of the laser energy in a number of laser accumulation pulses. This approach can not only improve the efficiency of silicon surface preparation of microstructures but also reduce the surface defects and damage. Furthermore, the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption in the process of femtosecond machining. It is of great significance for the engineering application of black silicon.

988,"A PIC/MCC simulation model for the analysis of low-temperature discharge plasmas is represented which takes the common leapfrog and the velocity Verlet algorithm for the particle integration, adaptive particle management as well as parallel computing using MPI into account. Main features of the model including the impact of super particle numbers, adaptive particle management and the time step size for the different integration methods are represented. The investigations are performed for low-pressure capacitively coupled radio frequency discharges in helium and argon. Besides a code verification by comparison with benchmark simulation results in helium it is shown that an adaptive particle management is particularly suitable for the simulation of discharges at elevated pressures where boundary effects and processes in the sheath regions are important. Furthermore, it is pointed out that the velocity Verlet integration scheme allows to speed up the PIC/MCC simulations compared to the leapfrog method because it makes the use of larger time steps at the same accuracy possible.

989,"A hanging-type sand-retaining wall is a very common sand-blocking fence structure used to prevent sand movement. This type of wall is widely used along the Qinghai-Tibet and Gobi desert railways in Xinjiang, Western China. To analyze the characteristics of wind-sand flow fields under the effect of such a sand fence structure, a wind tunnel test and a field test were carried out. The wind tunnel test showed the zoning characteristics of the flow fields under the effect of the hanging-type sand-retaining wall, and the field test provided the sediment transport data for effective wind-proof interval and the sand resistance data in the front and behind the sand-retaining wall. The consistency of the wind-sand flow fields with the spatial distribution characteristic of wind-carried sand motion was verified by the correspondences of the acceleration zone in the flow field and the negative elevation points of the percentage variations of the sand collection rate. The spatial distribution characteristic of the field sand collection data further showed the spatial structural characteristic of the sandy air currents under the action of the hanging-type sand-retaining wall and the sand resistance characteristic of the sand-retaining wall. This systematic study on the wind-sand flow fields under the control of the hanging-type sand-retaining wall provides a theoretical basis for the rational layout of sand control engineering systems and the efficient utilization of a hanging-type sand-retaining wall.

990,"1. The attraction of natural enemies towards herbivore-induced plant volatiles is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the majority of published studies are carried under optimal water and nutrient regimes and with just one herbivore. But what happens when additional levels of ecological complexity are added? Does the presence of a second herbivore, microorganisms, and abiotic stress interfere with plant-natural enemy communication? or is communication stable enough to withstand disruption by additional biotic and abiotic factors? 2. Investigating the effects of these additional levels of ecological complexity is key to understanding the stability of tritrophic interactions in natural ecosystems and may aid to forecast the impact of environmental disturbances on these, especially in climate change scenarios, which are often associated with modifications in plant and arthropod species distribution and increased levels of abiotic stress. 3. This review explores the literature on natural enemy attraction to herbivore-induced volatiles when, besides herbivory, plants are challenged by additional biotic and abiotic factors. 4. The aim of this review was to establish the impact of different biotic and abiotic factors on plant-natural enemy communication and to highlight critical aspects to guide future research efforts.

However, it remains a challenging task due to severe body deformation, erratic motion and frequent occlusions. This paper proposes a tracking method which is capable of tracking the midlines of multiple fish based on midline evolution and head motion pattern modeling with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The midline and head motion state are predicted using two LSTM networks respectively and the predicted state is associated with detections to estimate the state of each target at each moment. Experiment results show that the system can accurately track midline dynamics of multiple zebrafish even when mutual occlusions occur frequently.

992,"As building information modeling (BIM) systems continue to be widely adopted, there is an increasing demand for an active construction schedule management system with more advanced decision-making capabilities. For example, if overlapping between construction activities is significant, the performance of construction operations for the corresponding activities may deteriorate. Thus, a viable construction schedule should be formulated in order to minimize overlapping of proximate construction activities. An active system can be regarded as a certain solution for this issue. The purpose of this study is to develop a systematic methodology and computer system for an optimal construction schedule simulation that minimize overlapping activities for the enhancement of a project's operational performance. This study centers on identifying overlapping activities, applying fuzzy theory, and analyzing risk levels for schedule overlap issues. In addition, genetic algorithm (GA) theory is adopted for the minimization of the overlapping of highly risky activities. Finally, an optimal construction schedule that minimizes overlapping activities is suggested. The optimal schedule is visualized in a BIM-based four-dimensional (4D) computer-aided design (CAD) environment. The 4D CAD system developed in this study includes fuzzy and GA analysis functions with a schedule simulator. A case study on an actual project is introduced to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

993,"Adolescents in the United States are known to be sleep deprived; early school start times, a biological propensity to stay up late, and a variety of wake-inducing activities lead to teens who often do not sleep enough. This chronic lack of sleep has measurable negative effects on health and well-being for adolescents. Though research has documented adolescent sleep behavior, few studies have addressed perceptions of sleep. The purpose of this study was to identify common sources of sleep information for a sample of Southwestern adolescents and examine general message content delivered to adolescents by each source. A convenience sample of 51 adolescents (mean age 14.5) completed a semi-structured, in-person interview between October 2006 and November 2007 in a Tucson, Arizona high school. Participant observation and a brief questionnaire regarding parent behavior were used to triangulate results. Parents, teachers, and in some cases the media stressed the importance of sleep for teens, while friends typically complained of tiredness. Individual experiences of sleep were reported to shape future sleep behavior. Rationales for adequate sleep included value placed on alertness, health, and achievement. Improving sleep in adolescents will not only require further education of the ""sleep messengers"" about the negative health consequences of inadequate sleep, but a larger cultural shift in how healthy sleep for teenagers is conceived and prioritized by schools, families and adolescents themselves.

994,"A common issue with many system identification problems is that the true input to the system is unknown. This paper extends a previously presented indirect modelling framework that deals with identification of systems where the input is partially or fully unknown. In this framework, unknown inputs are eliminated by using additional measurements that directly or indirectly contain information about the unknown inputs. The resulting indirect predictor model is only dependent on known and measured signals and can be used to estimate the desired dynamics or properties. Since the input of the indirect model contains both known inputs and measurements that could all be correlated with the same disturbances as the output, estimation of the indirect model has similar challenges as a closed-loop estimation problem. In fact, due to the generality of the indirect modelling framework, it unifies a number of already existing system identification problems that are contained as special cases. For completeness, the paper is concluded with one method that can be used to estimate the indirect model as well as an experimental verification to show the applicability of the framework.

995,"A high frequency dual-buck full-bridge inverter for small power renewable energy applications is proposed in this paper. The implementation of the wide band gap SiC (Silicon Carbide) power device contributes to the high switching frequency of 400 kHz. This high frequency contributes to reduced converter volume as well as improved power density, which greatly strengthens its portability and application range. For the control strategy, a voltage-current dual loop controller is employed. A three-pole-three-zero (3P3Z) compensator is applied in the current loop in order to track the current reference without static error. A voltage loop two-pole two-zero (2P2Z) compensator is used to generate the current reference for stabilizing the DC bus voltage. Not only is the inner current loop analyzed in detail, which includes the modeling of the equivalent inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL)-type inverter and the design of the 3P3Z compensator, but also the outer voltage loop is discussed, the model of which is established based on the energy balance. Furthermore, a feedback linearization method is adopted to simplify the duty cycle calculation and helps to accelerate the control speed. A second-order generalized integrator software phase lock loop (SOGI-SPLL) is employed to obtain the phase angle and to synchronize the inverter output current with the grid voltage. A parallel structure algorithm is conducted based on a dual-core microcontroller unit (MCU) for the first time to control the high frequency inverter. This approach avoids the contradiction between the high frequency operation and the limited computing capacity of the conventional single-core MCUs. The software structure, time-consuming distribution, and interactive communication method are analyzed in detailed. Finally, this paper verifies the feasibility of the theoretical analyses through simulation and experiments based on a 1 kW prototype.

The proposed method comprises three steps. First, a SIFT detector is used to detect key points and then these points are described by Daisy instead of the SIFT detector (to improve efficiency); second, a new geometric constraint with distance and direction terms is designed and incorporated into sequential tree-reweighted message passing (TRW-S) this obtains the coarse matching result; finally, the RANSAC algorithm is adopted to filter out the mismatches and obtain an accurate transformation.

999,"Accurate prediction of software defects is of crucial importance in software engineering. Software defect prediction comprises two major procedures: (i) Design of appropriate software metrics to represent characteristic software system properties; and (ii) development of effective regression models for count data, allowing for accurate prediction of the number of software defects. Although significant research effort has been devoted to software metrics design, research in count data regression has been rather limited. More specifically, most used methods have not been explicitly designed to tackle the problem of metrics driven software defect counts prediction, thus postulating irrelevant assumptions, such as (log-)linearity of the modeled data. In addition, a lack of simple and efficient algorithms for posterior computation has made more elaborate hierarchical Bayesian approaches appear unattractive in the context of software defect prediction. To address these issues, in this paper we introduce a doubly stochastic Poisson process for count data regression, the failure log-rate of which is driven by a novel latent space stochastic feed forward neural network. Our approach yields simple and efficient updates for its complicated conditional distributions by means of sampling importance resampling and error backpropagation. We exhibit the efficacy of our approach using publicly available and benchmark datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose/introduction The investigation and treatment of osteoporosis after minimal trauma fracture (MTF) is regarded as sub-optimal. There is strong evidence of the benefit of identifying and treating osteoporosis after MTF, and there has been discussion of the possible role that orthopedic surgeons might play in the management of osteoporosis after MTF. The study surveyed orthopedic surgeons in rural and regional Southeast Australia to determine their attitudes to investigation and management of osteoporosis, the role health professionals should play, and the communication and coordination of follow-up care. Methods A survey was developed and piloted prior to being posted to 69 orthopedic surgeons asking for their opinions about the general management of osteoporosis, and the roles and responsibilities of health professionals in dealing with osteoporosis following an MTF. Results Responses were received from 42 participants (60.8%) with the majority of respondents agreeing that it is important to treat osteoporosis following MTF. Less than 15% of respondents felt that it was their responsibility to initiate discussion or treatment or investigation after MTF. No respondent felt that the coordination of osteoporosis care was good and 45% stated it was poor. Communication after discharge is mostly left to the hospital (30%), while 20% stated they did not follow up at all. This study shows that many rural orthopedic surgeons believe that follow-up in regard to osteoporosis after MTF is important, that responsibility for follow-up diagnosis and management of osteoporosis lies with primary health care and the current communication systems are poor.

The proposed metamaterial absorber has the advantage of ease design. It is a three layered structure, designed with modified ring resonators printed on a dielectric material with a metal ground. By proper tuning of the geometry parameters of the structure, a triple band metamaterial absorber is achieved and it is adjusted to match the effective impedance of metamaterial absorber to the free space. Hence, there is no wave transmission, minimized reflection and the absorption rate is maximized in all the bands. The resonant frequency bands are at 7.7 GHz, 9.2 GHz and 11.1 GHz with absorption rates of 99.7%, 98% and 94% respectively. The bandwidths measured at the triple band are 0.2757 GHz, 0.311 GHz and 0.2182 GHz. The total miniaturized metamaterial absorber unit cell size is 6 mm x 12 mm x 0.705 mm.

METHODS Fifty-one cirrhotic patients (17 with portal vein thrombosis) were analyzed. Serum omentin and vaspin levels were measured with commercially available direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). To assess platelet activity, the following tests were performed using a MULTIPLATE (R) PLATELET FUNCTION ANALYZER: (1) an ADP-induced platelet activation test; (2) a cyclooxygenase dependent aggregation test (ASPI test); (3) a von Willebrand factor and glycoprotein Ib-dependent aggregation (using ristocetin) test (RISTO test); and (4) a test for thrombin receptor-activating peptide-6 induced activation of the thrombin receptor, which is sensitive to IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. RESULTS Omentin, but not vaspin, serum concentrations were significantly decreased in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) (P = 0.01). Prothrombin levels were significantly increased in patients with PVT (P = 0.01). The thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) test results were significantly lower in the PVT group (P = 0.03). No significant differences in adipokines serum levels were found regarding the etiology or severity of liver cirrhosis assessed according to the Child-Pugh or Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. There was a significant increase in the TRAP (P = 0.03), ASPI (P = 0.001) and RISTO high-test (P = 0.02) results in patients with lower MELD scores. Serum omentin and vaspin levels were significantly down-regulated in patients without insulin resistance (P = 0.03, P = 0.02, respectively). A positive relationship between omentin and vaspin levels were found both when all of the patients were analyzed (r = 0.41, P = 0.01) and among those with PVT (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Serum omentin levels are increased in patients without PVT. Cirrhosis origin and grade do not affect omentin and vaspin levels. The analyzed adipokines do not influence platelet activity.

In a general situation, skin detectors, such as skin probability maps or Gaussian mixture models, achieve acceptable skin segmentation results. However, the false positive rate increases significantly when the skin tones are in shadow or when skin-like background objects are under similar illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel skin feature learning algorithm based on stacked autoencoders, which are deep neural networks. To overcome the problems encountered in skin segmentation that are caused by different ethnicities and varying illumination conditions, the stacked autoencoders are utilized to learn more discriminative representations of the skin area in both the RGB color space and the HSV color space. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, instead of predicting each pixel individually, our algorithm utilizes blocks to learn the representations and detect the skin areas. The algorithm exploits the learning ability of deep neural networks to learn high-level representations of skin tones. Experiments on test images show that the proposed algorithm achieves acceptable results on several publicly available data sets. To reduce the difficulty of detecting skin pixels in these data sets, the ground truths of these data sets are commonly focused on foreground skin area detection. Our skin detector is also able to detect background areas, as shown in our experiments.

1020,"A general formulation and solution of fractional optimal control problems (FOCPs) in terms of Caputo fractional derivatives (CFDs) of arbitrary order have been considered in this paper. The performance index (PI) of a FOCP is considered as a function of both the state and control. The dynamic constraint is expressed by a fractional differential equation (FDE) of arbitrary order. A general pseudo-state-space representation of the FDE is presented and based on that, FOCP has been developed. A numerical technique based on Grunwald-Letnikcov (G-L) approximation of the FDs is used for solving the resulting equations. Numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the formulation and solution scheme.

Two-thirds of the cases involve the membranous part of the septum. In the absence of an interventricular shunt or concomitant cardiac surgery, guidelines for surgical intervention or resection of isolated aneurysms of the membranous septum are not well established. In this report, we discuss a multi-imaging modality approach for the diagnosis and assessment of membranous ventricular septal aneurysms and review the experts' consensuses for follow-up and treatment strategies.

1022,"A gearless one-motor concept for contra-rotating fans is presented in this article. The rotors are mounted to an electric motor using only one shaft. The coupling between both rotors is realised by utilising the conservation of angular momentum. The contra-rotating fans has a diameter of 200mm at a design speed of 2100min(-1) for the first stage and 1200min(-1) for the second stage. It has been designed and investigated through a series of experiments by the Institute of Air Handling and Refrigeration in Dresden. The performance map and 2D particle image velocimetry measurements have been conducted. Numerical models for 3D quasi-steady state and transient simulations have been implemented and carried out by the Institute of Mechanics and Fluid Dynamics. The results show a good agreement between the quasi-steady, the transient simulations and the experiment. However, when close to stall, the time-resolved simulations show a superior performance compared with steady-state computations.

1023,"Aberrant angiogenesis and vascular remodeling are the main features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Kallistatin is an anti-angiogenic peptide with known effects on endothelial cells. This study aimed to demonstrate that kallistatin has beneficial effects on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a rat model by inhibiting angiogenesis. Twenty-five rats were randomly divided into five experimental groups: (A) Saline only (SA)-as the negative control, (B) BLM only (BLM)-as the model group, (C) BLM and 0.1 mg/kg kallistatin (L-Kal), (D) BLM and 0.5 mg/kg kallistatin (M-Kal), and (E) BLM and 2.5 mg/kg kallistatin (H-Kal). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA) and microvascular density (MVD) were measured by immunohistochemistry. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were assayed by Western immunoblotting or ELISA. Daily administration of kallistatin attenuated fibrosis in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as shown by histology. During inflammation from BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, kallistatin reduced the number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Kallistatin also inhibited VEGF expression and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Flk-1). In vitro, kallistatin blocked tube formation by inhibiting Flk-1 and GSK-3 beta phosphorylation. The results demonstrated that continuous administration of kallistatin attenuated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and improved survival of BLM rats. Reducing pulmonary fibrosis was achieved by partial inhibition of pulmonary inflammation and angiogenesis.

1026,"Aerial gamma ray surveys are an important tool for national security, scientific, arid industrial interests in determining locations of both anthropogenic and natural sources of radioactivity. There is a relationship between radioactivity and geology and in the past this relationship has been used to predict geology from an aerial survey. The purpose of this project is to develop a method to predict the radiologic exposure rate of the geologic materials by creating a high resolution background model. The intention is for this method to be used in an emergency response scenario where the background radiation environment is unknown. Two study areas in Southern Nevada have been modeled using geologic data, images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), geochemical data, and pre-existing low resolution aerial surveys from the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) Survey. Using these data, geospatial areas that are homogenous in terms of K, U, and Th, referred to as background radiation units, are defined and the gamma ray exposure rate is predicted. The prediction is compared to data collected via detailed aerial survey by the Department of Energy's Remote Sensing Lab - Nellis, allowing for the refinement of the technique. By using geologic units to define radiation background units of exposed bedrock and ASTER visualizations to subdivide and define radiation background units within alluvium, successful models have been produced for Government Wash, north of Lake Mead, and for the western shore of Lake Mohave, east of Searchlight, NV.

1027,"A new type of mechanically stabilised earth structure composed of geosynthetic tubes filled with expanded clay lightweight aggregate and backfill with geosynthetic reinforcement is introduced. The results of the study demonstrate that alternative solutions such as expanded clay lightweight aggregates can be used in interaction with geosynthetics in comparison to classical soil. The new type of geosynthetic tubes filled dynamically with expanded clay lightweight aggregate was tested in situ under compressive loading. The geosynthetic tube was instrumented with load cell transducers and the characteristic cross-section was obtained from three-dimensional scanner measurements after loading. Next, a simplified engineering formulation for geosynthetic tubes under compressive loading and unloading was evaluated including the influence of volume variation of the tube. It is based on the classical approach from soil mechanics and it produces the required design tensile force of the tube dependent on geosynthetic stiffness. The experimental results of compressive loading tests were compared with analytical equations. The results are discussed and show the influence of the geosynthetic stiffness on the behaviour of the tube in terms of loading capacity, volume variation and cross-section of the tube. The agreement between theoretical analyses and experimental results was reasonably good and can be formally accepted for a given volume variation of the geosynthetic tube.

Complex design is able to become simply and reduce weight of parts as functionalized materials. In the traditional mechanical polishing method, even though surface roughness is good after polishing, there still remains very slight polish mark and deformed layer. Therefore, such method is not applicable to the product which requires ultra-clean surface quality. Thus, it has introduced electrochemical polishing method that electrochemical elution is applied, excluding the traditional processing method that contact between tool and workpiece always happens. In the study, Taguchi design method was introduced. By applying Taguchi design, one can significantly reduce the time required for experimental investigation, as it is effective in investigating the effects of multiple factors on performance as well as to study the influence of individual factors to determine which factor has more influence, which less. Experimental results, increases the processing time in the case of electrochemical polishing Stainless steel 316L plates were able to confirm that the improved surface quality.

1029,"Age is a critical factor in the prevalence of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. To observe how an aging phenotype interacts with and affects the pathological intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, the tauopathy mouse model pR5 (expressing P301L mutant human tau) was back-crossed more than ten times onto a senescence-accelerated SAMP8 background to establish the new strain, SApT. Unlike SAMP8 mice, pR5 mice are characterized by a robust tau pathology particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus. Analysis of age-matched SApT mice revealed that pathological tau phosphorylation was increased in these brain regions compared to those in the parental pR5 strain. Moreover, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, phosphorylation of critical tau phospho-epitopes (P-Ser202/P-Ser205 and P-Ser235) was significantly increased in the amygdala of SApT mice in an age-dependent manner, suggesting an age-associated effect of tau phosphorylation. Anxiety tests revealed that the older cohort of SApT mice (10months vs. 8months) exhibited a behavioural pattern similar to that observed for age-matched tau transgenic pR5 mice and not the SAMP8 parental mice. Learning and memory, however, appeared to be governed by the accelerated aging background of the SAMP8 strain, as at both ages investigated, SAMP8 and SApT mice showed a decreased learning capacity compared to pR5 mice. We therefore conclude that accelerated aging exacerbates pathological tau phosphorylation, leading to changes in normal behaviour. These findings further suggest that SApT mice may be a useful novel model in which to study the role of a complex geriatric phenotype in tauopathy.

1030,"A digitally controlled sonar power amplifier for underwater transmitter is explained in this paper. It proposes a method of generating unipolar Sine Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) signals for echo ranging sonar. This method can be effectively used in all kinds of inverters including high frequency inverters. A low cost digital signal controller was used to generate SPWM signals and used as gating pulses for a Controlled Full Bridge Circuit (CFBC). The power required, frequency, pulse-width and pulse repetition interval are given as the inputs to the digital controller and gating pulses for the CFBC are generated as output from the controller. A power transformer connected across CFBC boosts output voltage followed by power filter which removes unwanted harmonics present in the output. The output after the power filter is used to excite electro-acoustic transducer elements underwater. The voltage and current of the load were given as feedback to the same controller for voltage mode control loop implementation of the system. A prototype of 1kW Switch Mode Power Amplifier (SMPA) for echo ranging sonar has been designed and digital control has been implemented. Salient results are presented.

1032,"A new nonisolated multiinput multioutput dc-dc boost converter is proposed in this paper. This converter is applicable in hybridizing alternative energy sources in electric vehicles. In fact, by hybridization of energy sources, advantages of different sources are achievable. In this converter, the loads power can be flexibly distributed between input sources. Also, charging or discharging of energy storages by other input sources can be controlled properly. The proposed converter has several outputs with different voltage levels which makes it suitable for interfacing to multilevel inverters. Using of a multilevel inverter leads to reduction of voltage harmonics which, consequently, reduces torque ripple of electric motor in electric vehicles. Also, electric vehicles which using dc motor have at least two different dc voltage levels, one for ventilation system and cabin lightening and other for supplying electric motor. The proposed converter has just one inductor. Depending on charging and discharging states of the energy storage system (ESS), two different power operation modes are defined for the converter. In order to design the converter control system, small-signal model for each operation mode is extracted. The validity of the proposed converter and its control performance are verified by simulation and experimental results for different operation conditions.

1033,"A seamless and secure handover is always one of the important design goals of the cellular networks. The handover scheme of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless networks is complex due to the presence of two possible different types of base stations. In LTE communication systems, a normal base station is referred to as an eNodeB (eNB). What increases the level of complexity of the system is the fact that the other kind of base stations, namely, Home eNodeB (HeNB), cannot directly communicate with eNB. In the LTE networks, the handover scenarios involving a HeNB could result in a complicated handover procedure. Besides, since key chains have been used in the handover processes, it is found to be lack of backward security. Therefore, in order to handle the handover involving a HeNB efficiently with security provisioning, in this paper, a proxy signature based handover scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme works based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm, which makes the computational cost of the handover process smaller compared to other handover schemes.

Dithering amplification effects on the control path are exploited during the steady-state converter operation. The noise injected is used to stimulate the loop reaction and to identify the output filter configuration. Oversampling-dithering features of third-order Delta Sigma modulators are used to increase the DPWM resolution during the converter nominal operation and, moreover, as the core key to compute the SI algorithm. A modified structure of a noise shaper is used to handle the resolution of the SI algorithm over a range of the desired frequencies during the nonparametric identification. The SI algorithm comprises two steps: the first processing step extracts the resonant frequency, and the second extracts the ESR zero from the power spectrum density computation of the control feedback error. The SI method has been validated with different buck converter configurations, and has successfully been integrated and measured into a digitally controlled buck converters prototype for automotive safety application.

1036,"A model that accurately predicts, at the time of admission, the Length of Stay (LOS) for hospitalized patients could be an effective tool for healthcare providers. It could enable early interventions to prevent complications, enabling more efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in hospitals. In this study, we apply a regression tree (Cubist) model for predicting the LOS, based on static inputs, that is, values that are known at the time of admission and that do not change during patient's hospital stay. The model was trained and validated on de-identified administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals in Pittsburgh, PA. We chose to use a Cubist model because it produced more accurate predictions than did alternative techniques. In addition, tree models enable us to examine the classification rules learned from the data, in order to better understand the factors that are most correlated with hospital LOS. Cubist recursively partitions the data set as it estimates linear regressions for each partition, and the error level differs for different partitions, so that it is possible to deduce what are the characteristics of patients whose LOS can be accurately predicted at admission, and what are the characteristics of patients for whom the LOS estimate at that point in time is more highly uncertain. For example, our model indicates that the prediction error is greater for patients who had more admissions in the recent past, and for those who had longer previous hospital stays. Our approach suggests that mapping the cases into a higher dimensional space, using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, helps to separate them by their level of Cubist error, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

1046,"Accumulating evidence suggests that post-diagnostic insulin levels may influence colorectal cancer (CRC) survival. Yet, no previous study has examined CRC survival in relation to a post-diagnostic diet rich in foods that increase post-prandial insulin levels. We hypothesized that glycemic and insulin scores (index or load; derived from food frequency questionnaire data) may be associated with survival from specific CRC subtypes sensitive to the insulin signaling pathway. We prospectively followed 1,160 CRC patients from the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2012) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2012), resulting in 266 CRC deaths in 10,235 person-years. CRC subtypes were defined by seven tumor biomarkers (KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations, and IRS1, IRS2, FASN and CTNNB1 expression) implicated in the insulin signaling pathway. For overall CRC and each subtype, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for an increase of one standard deviation in each of glycemic and insulin scores were estimated using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. We found that insulin scores, but not glycemic scores, were positively associated with CRC mortality (HR=1.19, 95% CI=1.02-1.38 for index; HR=1.23, 95% CI=1.04-1.47 for load). The significant positive associations appeared more pronounced among PIK3CA wild-type cases and FASN-negative cases, with HR ranging from 1.36 to 1.60 across insulin scores. However, we did not observe statistically significant interactions of insulin scores with PIK3CA, FASN, or any other tumor marker (p interaction>0.12). While additional studies are needed for definitive evidence, a high-insulinogenic diet after CRC diagnosis may contribute to worse CRC survival. What's new? Elevated circulating insulin levels are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis and may also be linked to CRC survival. According to this report, insulin's contribution to CRC prognosis are potentially reflected in differences in the insulinogenic diet-mortality association by tumor biomarkers related to the insulin signaling pathway. In a prospective cohort study of CRC patients, a high-insulinogenic diet was linked to poor CRC survival primarily when CRCs were of PIK3CA wild-type or FASN-negative, though the interactions were not statistically significant. Insulin scores were also significantly associated with all-cause mortality among FASN-negative cases. No associations were detected between glycemic scores and CRC mortality.

Its output size and running time are polynomial in (nD)(nlog(d)), where D is the maximum of the degrees of the input polynomials, d is the dimension of the set under consideration and n is the number of variables. More precisely, the running time of the algorithm is essentially subquadratic in the output size. Even under our assumptions, it is the first roadmap algorithm with output size and running time polynomial in (nD)(nlog(d)).

It combines the solar PV/T/D system with green building design. The PV/T/D system can achieve excellent light control at noon and adjust the thermal environment in the building, such that high efficiency utilization of solar energy could be achieved in modern architecture. This kind of roof can increase the visual comfort for building occupants; it can also avoid the building interior from overheating and dazzling at noon which is caused by direct sunlight through transparent roof. Optical simulation software is used to track the light path in different incidence angles. CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation and steady state experiment have been taken to investigate the thermal characteristic of PV/T/D device. Finally, the PV/T/D experimental system was built; and the PV efficiency, light transmittance and air heating power of the system are tested under real sky conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1050,"A flexible synthesis procedure for nth-order current-mode low-pass filter using current controlled current differencing buffered amplifier (CC-CDBA) is given. The proposed method is based on drawing the signal-flow graph from the given transfer function and obtaining the circuit realization from the graph. The proposed configuration uses n+1 CC-CIDBAs and n capacitors. It is straightforward to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized and the undamped natural frequency and quality factor can be adjusted electronically without changing the values of the passive components. The proposed structure uses the cascade connection of second and/or first order filter sections. Therefore it carries the general advantages of this type of structures. Further, any current ratio transfer function can be shown to be realized by adding a weighted summer without affecting the basic configuration. The simulation results for a fourth order band-pass elliptic filter are included for the verification of the theory.

1051,"A significant proportion of the solar irradiance that reaches the Earth's surface is normally attenuated by atmospheric properties and overcast conditions related to the rainy season. The Solar Analyst (SA) model, irradiance and long term precipitation data were used to assess this relationship in Guadalajara, Mexico. A spatial analysis based on morphological and statistical criteria increased the model's certainty. The SA model explains 95.4% of the irradiation variability observed on the ground, with average uncertainties of 3.7% during clear sky conditions in the dry season and 4.4% on sunny days in the wet season. The meteorological data analysis shows that total precipitation in 2014 had an atypical temporal distribution and was slightly lower (12.6%) than the average from 1991 to 2012. A deficit of 39% in precipitation compared to the long term average was found in the first half of the season, which was later partially compensated. This deficit was interpreted as a temporary delay in high values of precipitation. Based on the potential average irradiation from the SA model and field observations, it can be concluded that overcast conditions related to rainfall through 2014 attenuated approximately 28.5% of the incoming solar energy. Taking the global energy balance into account, this fraction was higher in comparison to the energy proportion reflected by the cloud's albedo (ca 23%). These results suggest that both the high proportion of energy attenuated and atypical weather conditions may be local effects of large-scale phenomena such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

1053,"A methodology for the design of a thermal distortion compensation system is presented which will assist the manufacturing processes to reach higher levels of accuracy when working with large machines in common shop floor environments. A parametric state-space representation was selected as model architecture, providing multiple inputs and outputs capability and a compact formulation that takes into account previous thermal states of the machine. Inputs for the model are spindle speed and temperatures of main motor gearbox and room air. Outputs are the estimations of the thermal drift of the machine tool centre point along the three axes in different positions within the working volume. Model parameters were numerically identified with initial experimental tests performed in a large gantry-type milling machine, measuring mentioned variables and also thermal distortion values using a reference artifact along with non-contact proximity sensors. Proposed model was finally verified with a new validation measurement in the machine. Obtained results revealed 80% of error reduction in the vertical axis which comprised 70% of total thermal effects and 50% in the longitudinal X axis which comprised 25% of total thermal effects. Also it was concluded that the model benefits from using valuable information about the machine state from previous spindle speed register instead of using only temperature values. Proposed methodology benefits from providing a feasible implementation in real shop floor conditions without the necessity of including additional temperature sensors or probing systems in the machine.

1054,"A promising development in the design of datacenters is the hybrid network architecture consisting of both optical and electrical elements. In this context, the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and VM-placement, a problem that only recently received attention in all-electrical datacenter networks, poses new and different challenges not addressed yet in hybrid datacenters. In particular, we foresee two issues: (i) the number of edge-switches that can be simultaneously reached using optical paths from an edge-switch is limited by the switch size, (ii) the dynamic creation of optical paths can potentially establish a constrained optical network topology leading to poor performance. We abstract the requests of tenants as virtual networks, and study the problem of embedding virtual networks on a hybrid datacenter, which translates to the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and placement such that the topology constraints of virtual networks are satisfied. We develop and analyse two algorithms for embedding dynamically arriving virtual network demands on a hybrid optical-electrical datacenter. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of not only exploiting the already established optical paths, but also of using electrical network in embedding requests of virtual networks.

1056,"Achieving security in distributed systems of constrained devices (like Wireless Sensor Networks) requires methods that can be performed while very limited computational, memory and communication resources are available. Moreover, while designing security protocols one needs take into account the adversary that can eavesdrop communication or compromise some of the devices. To achieve some level of security, two communicating devices need to establish a communication key. In the setting of severely constrained devices traditional methods are infeasible due to resource limitations, and one has to incorporate other security providing methods. One of the first such protocols has been introduced in Eschenauer and Gligor [24 The paper followed by dozens of others relies on probabilistic key sharing among the nodes before deployment (key predistribution) in the Ad Hoc environment. In our paper, we show that regular protocols of key predistribution designed primarily for providing confidentiality of communication do not provide privacy in many natural scenarios. More precisely, even a weak adversary may ""link"" transmissions of the same nodes. In particular even a passive adversary that is eavesdropping the communication can easily recognize whether the same devices start communication several times. Such information not only breaches nodes' privacy but also can be a starting point for an more advanced attacks and can give significant information about network's activity. We define several models of adversary and introduce some general methods that can be used for addressing this issue. For the model with weaker adversary we show how to fully secure the privacy in an efficient manner. For the case of stronger adversary, we propose a method based on local key exchange allowing mitigation of the privacy threat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many of these wells exceed the WHO As in drinking water standard of 10 mu g/L by a factor of 100. The aim of this study was to assess how cooking water source impacts dietary As intake in a rural community in Prey Veng. This aim was fulfilled by (1) using geostatistical analysis techniques to examine the extent of As contaminated groundwater in Prey Veng and identify a suitable study site, (2) conducting an on-site study in two villages to measure As content in cooked rice prepared with water collected from tubewells and locally harvested rainwater, and (3) determining the dietary intake of As from consuming this rice. Geostatistical analysis indicated that high risk tubewells (>50 mu g As/L) are concentrated along the Mekong River's east bank. Participants using high risk tubewells are consuming up to 24 times more inorganic As daily than recommended by the previous FAO/WHO provisional tolerable daily intake value (2.1 mu g/kgBW/day). However, As content in rice cooked in rainwater was significantly reduced, therefore, it is considered to be a safer and more sustainable option for this region.

One hundred and six extracts from 40 native Australian plant species traditionally used for the treatment of inflammation and/or to inhibit bacterial growth were investigated for their ability to inhibit the growth of a microbial trigger for ankylosing spondylitis (K. pneumoniae). Eighty-six of the extracts (81.1%) inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae. The D. leichardtii, Eucalyptus spp., K. flavescens, Leptospermum spp., M. quinquenervia, Petalostigma spp., P. angustifolium, S. spinescens, S. australe, S. forte and Tasmannia spp. extracts were effective K. pneumoniae growth inhibitors, with MIC values generally < 1000 A mu g/mL. The T. lanceolata peppercorn extracts were the most potent growth inhibitors, with MIC values as low as 16 A mu g/mL. These extracts were examined by non-biased GC-MS headspace analysis and comparison with a compound database. A notable feature was the high relative abundance of the sesquiterpenoids polygodial, guaiol and caryophyllene oxide, and the monoterpenoids linalool, cineole and alpha-terpineol in the T. lanceolata peppercorn methanolic and aqueous extracts. The extracts with the most potent K. pneumoniae inhibitory activity (including the T. lanceolata peppercorn extracts) were nontoxic in the Artemia nauplii bioassay. The lack of toxicity and the growth inhibitory activity of these extracts against K. pneumoniae indicate their potential for both preventing the onset of ankylosing spondylitis and minimising its symptoms once the disease is established.

1061,"A new full-precision algorithm to solve the Debye scattering equation has been developed for high-performance computing of powder diffraction line profiles from large-scale atomistic models of nanomaterials. The Debye function was evaluated using a pair distribution function computed with high accuracy, exploiting the series expansion of the error between calculated and equispace-sampled pair distances of atoms. The intensity uncertainty (standard deviation) of the computed diffraction profile was estimated as a function of the algorithm-intrinsic approximations and coordinate precision of the atomic positions, confirming the high accuracy of the simulated pattern. Based on the propagation of uncertainty, the new algorithm provides a more accurate powder diffraction profile than a brute-force calculation. Indeed, the precision of floating-point numbers employed in brute-force computations is worse than the estimated accuracy provided by the new algorithm. A software application, ROSE-X, has been implemented for parallel computing on CPU/GPU multi-core processors and distributed clusters. The computing performance is directly proportional to the total processor speed of the devices. An average speed of similar to 30 x 10(9) computed pair distances per second was measured, allowing simulation of the powder diffraction pattern of an similar to 23 million atom microstructure in a couple of hours. Moreover, the pair distribution function was recorded and reused to evaluate powder diffraction profiles of the same system with different properties (i.e. Q rather than 2 theta range, step and wavelength), avoiding additional pair distance computations. This approach was used to investigate a large collection of monoatomic and polyatomic microstructures, isolating the contribution from atoms belonging to different moieties (e.g. different species or crystalline domains).

1064,"A series of coupled thermo-hydraulic simulations were performed on a soil-geotextile column to understand the effect of temperature on suction distribution throughout the soil column and on the hydraulic performance of the geotextile as a drainage/capillary barrier layer. Two different constant temperatures of 0 degrees C and 38 degrees C and a temperature gradient of 4 degrees C along the column were modeled. Changing the temperature from 0 degrees C to 38 degrees C did not have a significant effect on the suction head distribution in the soil-geotextile column. The temperature gradient resulted in appreciable thermal vapor flow and changes in suction head and hydraulic conductivity of the geotextile. During drainage, the temperature gradient and lower temperature at the top of the column increased suction in the geotextile and its ability to function as a capillary barrier. During capillary rise, the temperature gradient and lower temperature at the top of the column decreased the suction in the geotextile and its ability to function as a capillary barrier. Changing the direction of the thermal gradient reversed the water vapor flow direction and its effect on the suction in the geotextile. A temperature gradient did not have a noticeable effect on the suction head of the geotextile when positive pore pressure was developed in the geotextile and adjacent soil during drainage.

The ability of light beams to detect and traverse shallow water columns has provided valuable information about unmapped and often poorly understood coastal and inland water bodies of the world. Estimating ALB survey results at varying water clarity and depth conditions is essential for realizing project expectations and preparing budgets accordingly. In remote locations of the world where in situ water clarity measurements are not feasible or possible, using multiband satellite imagery can be an effective tool for estimating and addressing such considerations. For this purpose, we studied and classified reflected electromagnetic energy from selected water bodies acquired by RapidEye sensor and then correlated findings with ALB survey results. This study was focused not on accurately measuring depth from optical bathymetry but rather on using multiband satellite imagery to quickly predict ALB survey results and identify potentially turbid water bodies with limited depth penetration. For this study, we constructed an in-house algorithm to confirm ALB survey findings using bathymetric waveform information.

While local voxelwise analyses showed associations between PiB and AV-1451 tracer largely in the temporal lobes, k-means clustering revealed that some of these associations were driven by regions with low tracer retention. We followed this up with a whole-brain region-by-region (local and non-local) partial correlational analysis. We calculated each participant's mean AV-1451 and PiB uptake values within 87 regions of interest (ROI). Pairwise ROI analysis demonstrated many positive PiB AV-1451 associations. Importantly, strong positive partial correlations (controlling for age, sex, and global gray matter fraction, p <.01) were identified between PiB in multiple regions of association cortex and AV-1451 in temporal cortical ROIs. There were also less frequent and weaker positive associations of regional PiB with frontoparietal AV-1451 uptake. Particularly in temporal lobe ROIs, AV-1451 uptake was strongly predicted by NB across multiple ROI locations. These data indicate that A beta and tau pathology show significant local and non-local regional associations among cognitively normal elderly, with increased PiB uptake throughout the cortex correlating with increased temporal lobe AV-1451 uptake. The spatial relationship between A beta and tau accumulation does not appear to be specific to A beta location, suggesting a regional vulnerability of temporal brain regions to tau accumulation regardless of where AP accumulates.

Appropriate power architectures and energy audits required for life support, and the propulsion and ancillary loads to support the continuous daily operation of the primary airship (cruiser) at stratospheric altitudes (circa 18 km), are also considered.

Prior to application, the 'Scotchrap' must be soaked in water after which it is applied in a way similar to that used for a plaster of paris bandage. The finished bandage remains elastic, allowing normal dorsal and plantar flexion of the foot, but preventing inversion and eversion, and pronation and supination. A t rest, the bandage always redresses the immobilized ankle into the neutral position, One hundred and thirty-six patients were included in the study. The semi-rigid bandage group comprised 59 patients and the tape group had 57 patients. These two groups were statistically comparable. The intake questionnaire included a general and a specific anamnesis form as well as a physical examination form. Follow-up data were recorded every 2 weeks. After termination of the treatment, the patients evaluated treatment efficacy. Statistical analysis of 126 items per patient with chi2-tests (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) and Fisher's exact tests (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) revealed no statistical significant differences in treatment result. The patient assessments of treatment efficacy of both types of bandage were also comparable. Both types of bandage gave sufficient stability (98%; p<0.005) and were equally effective. This study has shown that 'Scotchrap' can be used for lateral ankle ligament lesions with excellent short-term results. The technique for application of the 'Scotchrap' bandage is easy to learn, but must be considered thoroughly because any change in the technique will lead to changes in the rigidity of the bandage and early wastage. The semi-rigid bandage can also be used for the functional treatment of patients who are allergic to tape. Of more interest are the other fields of application in which this new material can be used, e.g. orthopaedic corsets, after-treatment for knee arthroscopies, achilles tendon ruptures, or even for wrist fractures.

The survey was designed to investigate how populations living in polluted areas could adopt prevention-oriented habits, fostered by the awareness of existing risks and, in addition, how increased knowledge of RP and information flows could support researchers in identifying recommendations, and presenting and disseminating HBM results. This study characterizes the four areas in terms of RP and access to and trust in environmental information, and provides insights into the influence of RP and environmental information on food consumption. For the data analysis, a combined random forest (RF) and logistic regression approach was carried out. RF was applied to the variables derived from the questionnaire in order to identify the most important in terms of the aims defined. Associations were then tested using Fisher's exact test and assessed with logistic regression in order to adjust for confounders. Results showed that the perception of and personal exposure to atmospheric and water pollution, hazardous industries and waste, hazardous material transportation and waste was higher in geographical areas characterized by anthropogenic pollution. Citizens living in industrial areas appeared to be aware of environmental risks and had more confidence in environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) than in public authorities. In addition, they reported an insufficient circulation of information. Concerning the influence of RP and environmental information on food consumption, a high perception of personal exposure to atmospheric pollution and hazardous industries was associated with a lower consumption of local fish.

In this implementation, the most popular open source IDS, Snort is used and the resultant intelligent IDS is named D-FRI-Snort. Experimental analysis shows that the integration of D-FRI with the IDS Snort provides an additional level of intelligence to predict the level/sensitivity of possible threats. It also provides a dynamic rule base by promoting new rules based on the current network traffic conditions, which helps Snort to reduce both false positives and false negatives.

1078,"Aim : The aim of this research was to evaluate if leaf removal and red geotextile reflective mulch ""Vitexsol"" could affect phenolic composition of wines from three white cultivars, Riesling italico, Traminer, and Manzoni bianco. Methods and results: A two-year study was conducted to evaluate the effects of leaf removal and reflective mulch on the phenolic composition of white wines from Zagreb vineyards in northwestern Croatia. Leaf removal (LR) and reflective mulch (RM) ""Vitexsol"", made from weave of aluminum platelets protected by a transparent film and sewn together with red polypropylene threads, were tested separately and combined (LR + RM) on vines of Traminer, Riesling italico and Manzoni bianco in 2008 and 2009. LR and RM had no consistent effect on must sugar content and titratable acidity. All treatments resulted in higher total phenol and flavan-3-ol content in wines of all cultivars, but in different years. LR + RM generally resulted in the highest phenolic acid and individual flavan-3-ol content in all wines except Traminer. RM treatment had the least effect on phenolic composition of wines. Conclusion: LR + RM generally resulted in the highest content of most phenolic compounds, especially when compared to control wines. Significance and impact of the study: This work provides some useful informations for adjusting vineyard practices and thus optimizing phenolic quality of white wines.

1079,"A Summary The majority of patients do not receive anti-osteoporotic treatment following a major osteoporotic fracture, despite the guidelines and the availability of effective anti-osteoporotic treatments. The fight against factors limiting the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis should become a priority to improve secondary prevention after an initial osteoporotic fracture. Purpose Despite the availability of effective anti-osteoporotic treatments, osteoporosis management is currently insufficient. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of anti-osteoporotic treatments introduced after an initial prior major osteoporotic fracture during hospitalization for recurring fractures. Methods We conducted an observational, cross-sectional, bicentric study that included all patients aged over 50 years who were hospitalized or seen in consultation for major osteoporotic fracture. Results One hundred twenty-eight out of two hundred four (62.7%) patients had a past history of major osteoporotic fracture and therefore had an indication of treatment based on guidelines. Among these patients, only 43/128 (33.5%) had received anti-osteoporotic treatment as secondary prevention after the initial fracture. The main causes of non-prescription identified were the attending physicians' ignorance of the indication of treatment (n = 30; 35.3%), ignorance of the fracture (n = 17; 20%), and comorbidities (n = 12; 14.1%). The failure to introduce treatment was associated with the presence of comorbidities with a Charlson Comorbidity Index = 6 (OR = 0.34 [0.16-0.73], p < 0.05), dementia (OR = 0.23 [0.08-0.72], p < 0.05), and past history of proximal femur fracture (OR = 0.20 [0.04-0.91], p < 0.05). Conclusions Two thirds of patients with a past history of major osteoporotic fracture presenting with a new fracture were not treated. The main reason for lack of treatment seems to stem from the incorrect assessment of the patient's fracture risk. Although major osteoporotic fracture leads to an increased risk of mortality and requires treatment, the significance of patient comorbidities was an independent risk factor leading to non-treatment.

1080,"An analysis framework for vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction system under turbulent wind is proposed based on the relevant theory of wind engineering and dynamics. Considering the fluctuating properties of wind field, the stochastic wind velocity time history is simulated by the Auto-Regressive method in terms of power spectral density function of wind field. The bridge is represented by three-dimensional finite element model and the vehicle by a multi-rigid-body system connected by springs and dashpots. The detailed calculation formulas of unsteady aerodynamic forces on bridge and vehicle are derived. In addition, the form selection of wind barriers, which are applied as the windbreak measures of newly-built railways in northwest China, is studied based on the suggested evaluation index, and the suitable values about height and porosity rate of wind barriers are studied. By taking a multi-span simply-supported box-girder bridge as a case study, the dynamic response of the bridge and the running safety indices of the train traveling on the bridge with and without wind barriers are calculated. The limit values of train speed with respect to different wind velocities are proposed according to the allowance values in the design code.

Those electronic environments will be fully populated with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of connected devices that share information and thus become intelligent. That massive wave of electronic devices will also invade everyday objects, turning them into smart entities, keeping their native features and characteristics while seamlessly promoting them to a new class of thinking and reasoning everyday objects. Although there are strong expectations that most of the users' needs can be fulfilled without their intervention, there are still situations where interaction is required. This paper presents work being done in the field of human-computer interaction, focusing on smart home environments, while being a part of a larger project called Aging Inside a Smart Home. This initiative arose as a way to deal with a large scourge of our country, where lots of elderly persons live alone in their homes, often with limited or no physical mobility. The project relies on the mobile agent computing paradigm in order to create a Virtual Butler that provides the interface between the elderly and the smart home infrastructure. The Virtual Butler is receptive to user questions, answering them according to the context and knowledge of the AISH. It is also capable of interacting with the user whenever it senses that something has gone wrong, notifying next of kin and/or medical services, etc. The Virtual Butler is aware of the user location and moves to the computing device which is closest to the user, in order to be always present. Its avatar can also run in handheld devices keeping its main functionality in order to track user when s/he goes out. According to the evaluation carried out, the Virtual Butler is assessed as a very interesting and loved digital friend, filling the gap between the user and the smart home. The evaluation also showed that the Virtual Butler concept can be easily ported to other types of possible smart and assistive environments like airports, hospitals, shopping malls, offices, etc.

1082,"A model to predict the motor temperature of an electrical submersible pump (ESP), under variable conditions of flow rate and loading, has been developed. This model takes into account the coupled behavior between motor, pump and production system. Thus, given a defined frequency in the variable speed drive, the motor temperature was determined as a result of the equilibrium between the heat generation, calculated from the power that the pump demands from the motor, and the heat extraction resistance, calculated from the production flow rate around the motor. Furthermore, in real field operations, the measurement of the motor temperature is made at the lower end of the stator winding, which is not exactly the maximum temperature point. In order to predict the maximum motor temperature value, the model developed in this work determines the motor temperature distribution. A convective heat transfer study has also been made comparing models based on fully developed temperature profile to models that consider the development of the thermal boundary layer. A case study has been made with several oil viscosities and water cut. The results showed a fact commonly observed in ESP field operations, that is, the motor temperature rises when the motor speed is continuously increased. It was also shown that neglecting the effect of the thermal boundary layer development may result in an overheated motor prediction where actually, the motor maximum temperature is much lower than its upper limit. Thus, it was observed that fully developed temperature profile models suffer from inaccuracy when used in viscous oil applications, because of their great thermal entry length. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1083,"A ground surface roughness measurement method is proposed to address current problems in the use of machine vision technology to measure roughness: the calculations are complex, and the measurement process is largely affected by the light source. Based on the area of diffusion regions between the virtual images formed by a light source on ground surfaces with different roughness levels are different, a reference light source containing two base color is designed. Red and green color space-based color distribution statistical matrices, as well as corresponding overlap indices, are proposed. A relationship model between overlap index and roughness is constructed. The effect of light source brightness and texture direction on the relationship model is discussed based on the experimental data. The results demonstrate that the surface roughness measurement method, which is based on the overlap degree of the color image, has relatively high accuracy and a relatively wide measurement range and is, to a certain degree, robust to the brightness of the light source and the texture direction. The surface roughness measurement method has huge potential for engineering applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1085,"As an important regulator of pollutants in overland flow and interflow, land use has become an essential research component for determining the relationships between surface water quality and pollution sources. This study investigated the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to identify the impact of land use and population density on surface water quality in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed of eastern China. A manual variable excluding-selecting method was explored to resolve multicollinearity issues. Standard regression coefficient analysis coupled with cluster analysis was introduced to determine which variable had the greatest influence on water quality. Results showed that: (1) Impact of land use on water quality varied with spatial and seasonal scales. Both positive and negative effects for certain land-use indicators were found in different subcatchments. (2) Urban land was the dominant factor influencing N, P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in highly urbanized regions, but the relationship was weak as the pollutants were mainly from point sources. Agricultural land was the primary factor influencing N and P in suburban and rural areas; the relationship was strong as the pollutants were mainly from agricultural surface runoff. Subcatchments located in suburban areas were identified with urban land as the primary influencing factor during the wet season while agricultural land was identified as a more prevalent influencing factor during the dry season. (3) Adjusted R-2 values in OLS models using the manual variable excluding-selecting method averaged 14.3% higher than using stepwise multiple linear regressions. However, the corresponding GWR models had adjusted R-2 similar to 59.2% higher than the optimal OLS models, confirming that GWR models demonstrated better prediction accuracy. Based on our findings, water resource protection policies should consider site-specific land-use conditions within each watershed to optimize mitigation strategies for contrasting land-use characteristics and seasonal variations.

Large-scale Red List assessment of plant species is a challenge, as most species' ranges have only been resolved to a coarse scale. As geographic distribution is a key assessment criterion on the IUCN Red List, we evaluate the use of coarse-scale distribution data in predictive models to assess the global scale and drivers of extinction risk in an economically important plant group, the bulbous monocotyledons. Location Global. Methods Using coarse-scale species distribution data, we train a machine learning model on biological and environmental variables for 148 species assessed on the IUCN Red List in order to identify correlates of extinction risk. We predict the extinction risk of 6439 'bulbous monocot' species with the best of 13 models and map our predictions to identify potential hotspots of threat. Results Our model achieved 91% classification accuracy, with 88% of threatened species and 93% of non-threatened species accurately predicted. The model predicted 35% of bulbous monocots presently 'Not Evaluated' under IUCN criteria to be threatened and human impacts were a key correlate of threat. Spatial analysis identified some hotspots of threat where no bulbous monocots are yet on the IUCN Red List, for example central Chile. Main conclusions This is the first time a machine learning model has been used to determine extinction risk at a global scale in a species-rich plant group. As coarse-scale distribution data exist for many plant groups, our methods can be replicated to provide extinction risk predictions across the plant kingdom. Our approach can be used as a low-cost prioritization tool for targeting field based assessments.

1088,"A critical aspect of dimensionality reduction is to assess the quality of selected (or produced) feature subsets properly. Feature subset assessment in machine learning refers to split a given feature subset into a training set, which is used to estimate the parameters of a classification model, and a test set used to estimate the predictive performance of the model. Then, averaging the results of multiple splitting (i.e., Cross-Validation, CV) is commonly used to decrease the variance of the estimator. But in practice, CV scheme is very computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a new statistics index method called LW-index for evaluation of feature subset and dimensionality reduction algorithms in general. The proposed method is a type of ""classical statistics"" approach that uses the feature subset to compute an empirical estimate of the quality of feature subset. A large number of performance comparisons with the machine learning approach conducted on fourteen benchmark collections show that the proposed LW index is highly correlated with the external indices (i.e., MacroF(1), MicroF(1)) of SVM and Centroid-Based Classifier (CBC) trained by five-fold CV scheme. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that LW index has the same performance as the traditional CV scheme for evaluating the dimensionality reduction algorithms and it is more efficient than the traditional methodology. Therefore, one contribution of this paper is to present an alternative methodology, based on an internal index typically used in the unsupervised learning context, that is computationally cheaper than the traditional CV methodology. Another contribution is to propose a new internal index that behaves better than other similar indices widely used in clustering and shows high correlation with the results obtained by the traditional methodology.

1090,"According to developmental niche theory, members of different cultural and ethnic groups often have distinct ideas about what children need to become well-adapted adults. These beliefs are reflected in parents' long-term socialization goals for their children. In this study, we test whether specific themes that have been deemed important in literature on diverse families in the United States (e.g., Strong Black Woman [SBW], marianismo, familismo) are evident in mothers' long-term socialization goals. Participants included 192 mothers of teenage daughters from a low-income city in the United States (58% Latina, 22% African American, and 20% European American [EA]/White). Socialization goals were assessed through a q-sort task on important traits for a woman to possess and content analysis of open-ended responses about what values mothers hoped they would transmit to their daughters as they become adults. Results from ANCOVAs and logistic regression indicate significant racial/ethnic differences on both tasks consistent with hypotheses. On the q-sort task, African American mothers put more importance on women possessing traits such as independence than mothers from other racial/ethnic groups. Similarly, they were more likely to emphasize self-confidence and strength in what they hoped to transmit to their daughters. Contrary to expectation, Latina mothers did not emphasize social traits on the q-sort; however, in open-ended responses, they were more likely to focus on the importance of motherhood, one aspect of marianismo and familismo. Overall, results suggest that these mothers' long-term socialization goals incorporate culturally relevant values considered important for African American and Latino families.

These points monitored for 18 parameters (water temperature, pH, TN, TP, TOC, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, Cr, Cd, Mn, B, Fe, Al, Mg, and Ba). The spatial variability, contamination sources and health risk of trace elements as well as the river Water quality were investigated. Our results were compared with national (CSEPA) and international (WHO, USEPA) drinking water guidelines, revealing that Zn, Cd and Pb were the dominant pollutants in the water body. Application of different multivariate statistical approaches, including correlation matrix and factor/principal component analysis (FA/PCA), to assess the origins of the elements in the Huaihe River, identified three source types that accounted for 79.31% of the total variance. Anthropogenic activities were considered to contribute Much of the Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, and Mn via industrial waste, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust; Ba, B, Cr and Cu were controlled by mixed anthropogenic and natural sources, and Mg, Fe and Al had natural origins from weathered rocks and crustal materials. Cluster analysis (CA) was used to classify the 53 sample points into three groups of water pollution, high pollution, moderate pollution, and low pollution, reflecting influences from tributaries, power plants and vehicle exhaust, and agricultural activities, respectively. The results of the water quality index (WO) indicate that Water in the Huaihe River is heavily polluted by trace elements, so approximately 96% of the water in the Huaihe River is unsuitable for drinking. A health risk assessment using the hazard quotient and index (HQ/HI) recommended by the USEPA suggests that Co, Cd and Pb in the river could cause non-carcinogenic harm to human health.

Structural analysis indicates that PDOPA was successfully anchored onto rGOs through non-covalent linkage under mild conditions. The presence of PDOPA layer between rGO and PVDF can not only prevent the agglomeration and direct contact of original rGOs but also enhance the interaction between PVDF and rGO and microcapacitor formation. Compared to rGO/PVDF composites, higher dielectric permittivity and lower loss factor were achieved simultaneously in rGO@PDOPA/PVDF nanocomposites at low and moderate frequencies. The PDOPA interface layers are effective in modifying the dielectric characteristics of the composites to increase the dielectric permittivity without the introduction of loss mechanisms.

Processing and analysing data under such circumstances is time consuming and makes it difficult to obtain efficient predictive models.

This paper presents a new relevancy-redundancy approach, called the maximum relevance minimum multicollinearity (MRmMC) method, for feature selection and ranking, which can overcome some shortcomings of existing criteria. In the proposed method, relevant features are measured by correlation characteristics based on conditional variance while redundancy elimination is achieved according to multiple correlation assessment using an orthogonal projection scheme.

The design was adapted to the Desert Southwest region of the United States based on thirty years of daily historical climate data including precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Four cities including El Paso, TX, Albuquerque, NM, Phoenix, AZ, and Pahrump, NV, were selected to represent the area. The residential lot was broken up into micro-watersheds reflecting the runoff of water from each separate portion of the house roof, driveway, and lawn area. The paper explains in detail the design steps for one of the micro-watersheds where water retention and infiltration structures were distributed throughout the soil area to capture stormwater runoff close to its source. A passive rainwater capture landscape was obtained by using the stormwater captured in the infiltration structures and stored in the surrounding soil. Native vegetation (shrubs and trees) will use this water exclusively for growth. These plants will not require watering once their root establishment period has passed, except in extreme droughts. Meanwhile, stormwater discharge from the lot will decrease and the groundwater recharge will increase. Results indicate that the current urban water budget can be made sustainable by replacing watering of landscape by municipal water with harvested stormwater. This results in a relatively lush and shady environment even in desert climates. The success is an artifact of the tendency of urban watersheds to increase the volume of stormwater relative to pre-development conditions.

Patients enrolled in the Lombardy Rheumatology Network (LORHEN) Registry after January 1, 2010, when all considered bDMARD agents were available, were included. The population was divided into ""first-"" and ""second-line"" bDMARD. We included 1910 patients (first line n = 1264, second line n = 646). Age was higher in ABA or TCZ vs TNFi treated patients (p < 0.0001). Positive latent tuberculosis screening was associated with first-line ABA (p = 0.002). Methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy was lower in the TCZ group (p = 0.02). The type (dyslipidemia, hypertension, pulmonary disease) and the number of comorbidities influenced the choice towards ABA (p = 0.01). Multinomial logistic regression demonstrated that a second-line treatment, higher age, dyslipidemia, pulmonary disease, other comorbidities, and extra-articular RA manifestations were associated with ABA compared to TNFi. TCZ was associated with a second-line treatment, higher age, and more severe disease activity. Stopping the first bDMARD due to adverse events (AE) influenced the choice towards ABA. In real life, higher age and comorbidities influence the choice towards ABA and TCZ compared to TNFi. ABA was preferred in case of suspension of previous treatments due to AE. After failing a first-line TNFi, swapping to a different mechanism of action is more common.

1100,"A number of resistive switching memories exhibit activation-based dynamical behavior, which makes them suitable for neuromorphic and programmable analog filtering applications. Because the Boundary Condition Memristor (BCM) model accounts for tunable activation thresholds only at the on and off boundary states, it is not quantitatively accurate in the description of these kinds of memristors and in the investigation of their circuit applications. This paper introduces the Generalized Boundary Condition Memristor (GBCM) model, preserving the features of the BCM model while allowing, further, an ad-hoc tuning of activation-based dynamics, which enables an appropriate modulation of the conditions under which memristors may operate as storage elements or data processors. A simple circuit implementation of the novel model is presented, and time-efficient simulations confirming the improvement in modeling accuracy over the BCM model are shown. As a proof-of-concept for the suitability of the GBCM model in the exploration of the full potential of memristors in neuromorphic circuits and programmable analog filters, this paper adopts it to model fundamental synaptic rules governing the mechanisms of learning in neural systems and to gain some insight into key issues in the design of a couple of filters.

1102,"Ambient Intelligence is the next wave in computing and communication technology. Nano-sensors, wireless networks and unified intelligent software are the main elements of this issue. Inputs of ambient intelligence are taken from sensors in the environment. Wireless sensor networks consists of small and low cost sensors that collect and report environmental data. Wireless sensors are dispersed in an area that some phenomenon or event should be monitored. When a sensor detects the monitored event (heat, pressure, sound, light, areas having magnetic properties, vibration, etc.), the event is reported to one of the sites. This site performs an appropriate task such as sending a message or local processing based on the type of network, and then provides the appropriate response. One of the major challenges in wireless sensor networks is optimizing the energy consumption. Studies have shown that by clustering network nodes, it is possible to use their energy more efficiently. This study proposes a clustering based routing method to be used in wireless sensor networks. Multi-objective optimization algorithm named as Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used for clustering and seven objective functions are described. It is aimed to carry out several goals at once by using multi objective algorithm. While communication cost between the objective functions and cluster-head and Sink, and cluster-head and non-cluster-head is tried to be minimized, selection of the cluster heads only from the nodes near Sink is also tried to be prevented and it is also taken into consideration for clusters to include more nodes as much as possible. Each solution of the solution set obtained with Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II points a different network topology. Each solution in solution set is the best solution according to some of objective functions. It is provided that Sink simulate each solution in solution set according to a certain scenario and choose one suitable for the desired criteria. In proposed method, both operating the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and, simulation and evaluation of the obtained solutions comes out in Sink which has sufficient operation and power sources. According to the results, the proposed method can make the life span of network five times longer than LEACH, which is the most famous clustering algorithm. Besides, while the proposed method extends the life span of network, it is also seen that it increases the number of the packet reaching Sink two times more than LEACH.

1104,"A new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), the high-speed charge-to-time converter (QTC) IWATSU CLC101, provides three channels, each consisting of preamplifier, discriminator, low-pass filter, and charge integration circuitry, optimized for the waveform of a photomultiplier tube (PMT). This ASIC detects PMT signals using individual built-in discriminators and drives output timing signals whose width represents the integrated charge of the PMT signal. Combined with external input circuits composed of passive elements, the QTC provides full analog signal processing for the detector's PMTs, ready for further processing by time-to-digital converters (TDCs). High-rate ( >1 MHz) signal processing is achieved by short-charge-conversion-time and baseline-restoration circuits. Wide-range charge measurements are enabled by offering three gain ranges while maintaining a short cycle time. QTC chip test results show good analog performance, with efficient detection for a single photoelectron signal, four orders of magnitude dynamic range (0.3 mV similar to 3 V; 0.2 similar to 2500 pC). 1% charge linearity, 0.2 pC charge resolution, and 0.1 ns timing resolution.

1106,"A 40-nm microcontroller featuring voltage stacked memory and logic is presented. This involved connecting the power domains of the memory and logic in series, such that the ground of one power domain is connected to the positive supply rail of the other. In this paper, an ARM Cortex-M0+ and its peripherals are powered from 0 V to V-DD, while its 4-kB ROM and the 16-kB SRAM are powered from V-DD to 2 V-DD. Since the memory and logic will, in general, draw different supply currents, the midrail V-DD is provided by an on-chip switched capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR). To allow a direct comparison of voltage stacking with a conventional single supply, it can be turned off by configuring the SCVR to power both the memory and logic from 0 V and V-DD. Turning on voltage stacking results in 96% power conversion efficiency, while the active converter area is reduced by 2.6x. Despite the use of a smaller SCVR, the voltage stacking reduces the supply noise by 3.4 dB and the output voltage drops from 58 to 36 mV.

Although basic mechanisms of its origin and development are known, some important steps in this process are still waiting for more detailed explanation. Therefore, in addition to already proved aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol, appropriate timing of atherosclerosis treatment is of the essence. Revealing different stages of atherosclerotic process, less or more sensitive to treatment is of primary importance; however, its detection is complicated by several facts including not exactly identifiable periods of quiescence and progression of atherosclerotic process. One of populations, study of which could add valuable information regarding this problem, are women in menopausal transition. Previously unsuccessful therapy with hormone replacement therapy is restudied with focus on the time of/after menopause. Now, it is supposed to be favorable in women soon, approximately less than 8 years, after menopause. In addition, the same principle - optimal timing of the intervention of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, especially lipids, could be also of importance. Therefore, menopausal transition could be optimal period for the intervention in women at risk. However, this approach is to be proved by evidence from controlled prospective studies focused on lifestyle and/or pharmacological intervention.

As a unique and important ecosystem, the Everglades provide a variety of important environmental services for society and nature. Over the past century and a half, anthropogenic actions have severely impacted the Everglades by disrupting the natural water flow and causing water pollution. As a result, the native flora and fauna have been displaced, important habitats have been lost, invasive species have become prevalent, and water contaminant concentrations have increased. Accelerating efforts are being made towards preserving the Everglades ecosystem by restoring water flow and improving water quality. To explore this complex and important aquatic ecosystem, we critically review the relevant environmental history, major terrestrial and aquatic characteristics and dynamics, engineered changes to water flow, major sources and impacts of nutrient pollution, trends in system response to pollution and mitigation actions, and recent regulatory efforts driving restoration.

Long-term cyclic 17 beta-estradiol treatment rescues cognitive deficits in aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys while restoring highly plastic synapses. Here we tested whether distributions of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) within monkey layer III dlPFC synapses are sensitive to age and estradiol, and coupled to cognitive function. Ovariectomized young and aged monkeys administered vehicle or estradiol were first tested on a delayed response test of working memory. Then, quantitative serial section immunoelectron microscopy was used to determine the distributions of synaptic GPER1. GPER1-containing nonperforated axospinous synapse density was reduced with age, and partially restored with estrogen treatment. The majority of synapses expressed GPER1, which was predominately localized to presynaptic cytoplasm and mitochondria. GPER1 was also abundant at plasmalemmas, and within cytoplasmic and postsynaptic density (PSD) domains of dendritic spines. GPER1 levels did not differ with age or treatment, and none of the variables examined were tightly associated with cognitive function. However, greater representation of GPER1 subjacent to the PSD accompanied higher synapse density. These data suggest that GPER1 is positioned to support diverse functions key to synaptic plasticity in monkey dlPFC.

1113,"A moisturizing cream mixed with a steroid ointment is frequently prescribed to patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. However, there is a concern that the mixing operation causes destabilization. The present study was performed to investigate the stability of such preparations closely using magnetic resonance imaging (MR1). As sample preparations, five commercial moisturizing creams that are popular in Japan were mixed with an ointment base, a white petrolatum, at a volume ratio of 1:1. The mixed preparations were stored at 60 degrees C to accelerate the destabilization processes. Subsequently, the phase separations induced by the storage test were monitored using MR1. Using advanced MR technologies including spin spin relaxation time (T-2) mapping and MR spectroscopy, we successfully characterized the phase-separation behavior of the test samples. For most samples, phase separations developed by the bleeding of liquid oil components. From a sample consisting of an oil-in-water-type cream, Urepearl Cream 10%, a distinct phase-separation mode was observed, which was initiated by the aqueous component separating from the bottom part of the sample. The resultant phase separation was the most distinct among the test samples. To investigate the phase separation quantitatively and objectively, we conducted a histogram analysis on the acquired T-2 maps. The water-in-oil type creams were found to be much more stable after mixing with ointment base than those of oil-in-water type creams. This finding strongly supported the validity of the mixing operation traditionally conducted in pharmacies.

1114,"Advances in our understanding of the human pain experience have shifted much of the focus of pain research from the periphery to the brain. Current hypotheses suggest that the progression of migraine depends on abnormal functioning of neurons in multiple brain regions. Accordingly, we sought to capture functional brain changes induced by the application of an inflammatory cocktail known as inflammatory soup (IS), to the dura mater across multiple brain networks. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether IS alters additional neural networks indirectly related to the primary nociceptive pathways via the spinal cord to the thalamus and cortex. IS comprises an acidic combination of bradykinin, serotonin, histamine and prostaglandin PGE2 and was introduced to basic pain research as a tool to activate and sensitize peripheral nociceptors when studying pathological pain conditions associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. Using this model of intracranial pain, we found that dural application of IS in awake, fully conscious, rats enhanced thalamic, hypothalamic, hippocampal and somatosensory cortex responses to mechanical stimulation of the face (compared to sham synthetic interstitial fluid administration). Furthermore, resting state MRI data revealed altered functional connectivity in a number of networks previously identified in clinical chronic pain populations. These included the default mode, sensorimotor, interoceptive (Salience) and autonomic networks. The findings suggest that activation and sensitization of meningeal nociceptors by IS can enhance the extent to which the brain processes nociceptive signaling, define new level of modulation of affective and cognitive responses to pain; set new tone for hypothalamic regulation of autonomic outflow to the cranium; and change cerebellar functions.

Different from conventional designs, a low-dropout regulator (LDO) with an NMOS power stage is used without the need for an additional step-up CP for driving. A clock tripler and a pulse divider are proposed to enable the Fast-RAP control. As the Fast-RAP digital controller is designed to be able to respond faster than the cascaded linear regulator, transient response will not be affected by the adaptive scheme. Thus, light-load efficiency is improved without sacrificing the response time. When the CP operates at 90 MHz with 80.3% CP efficiency, only small ripples would appear on the CP output with the 18-phase interleaving scheme, and be further attenuated at VOUT by the 50-mV dropout regulator with only 4.1% efficiency overhead and 6.5% area overhead.

1118,"Application of microscopy to evaluate the morphology and size of filamentous proteins and amyloids requires new and creative approaches to simplify and automate the image processing. The estimation of mean values of fibrils diameter, length and bending stiffness on micrographs is a major challenge. For this purpose we developed an open-source Fibril) plugin for the ImageJ/FiJi program. It automatically recognizes the fibrils on the surface of a mica, silicon, gold or formvar film and further analyzes them to calculate the distribution of fibrils by diameters, lengths and persistence lengths. The plugin has been validated by the processing of TEM images of fibrils formed by Sup35NM yeast protein and artificially created images of rod-shape objects with predefined parameters. Novel data obtained by SEM for Sup35NM protein fibrils immobilized on silicon and gold substrates are also presented and analyzed. Program summary Program title: FibrilJ Program Files doi: http://dx.doLorg/10.17632/ndxb93h4vc.1 Licensing provisions: Apache-2.0 Programming language: ImageJ Macro Language Nature of problem: Amyloids are large protein aggregates that form Unbranched fibrils. Formation of amyloids by different proteins leads to the emergence of a number of serious human diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Therefore, various amyloids, in particular their topology, are widely studied in an enormous number of papers. The structural organization of the amyloid aggregates at the molecular level is a key problem in this area. At the moment new methods of amyloids analysis based on electronic and probe microscopy are particularly popular. Usually it is required to process images containing hundreds of amyloids to obtain statistically reliable data on the distribution of the thickness, length and persistence length (a basic mechanical property quantifying the stiffness of a polymer). The lattermost parameter was introduced for the chatkteristic of bending stiffness of amyloids similarly to that in a model of wormlike chain for polymers. The manual measurements of these parameters take a lot of time and, due to the human factor, are insufficiently representative. ImageJ/FiJi is open-source software and one of the most commonly used program for image processing. The ImageJ/FiJi community provides BoneJ plugin for bones analysis and Diameter! plugin for nanofibers analysis, which have the function of determining the diameter of the respective objects. Also, approaches that involve calculations of the end-to-end distances and contour lengths of biopolymers were used to determine their persistence lengths using ImageJ/FiJi. These above mentioned plugins are not designed for the study of amyloids and have never been used or validated for them. They do not provide the necessary functionality for the automatic recognition of amyloids on the substrate and filtering objects by a number of parameters. They have unspecified accuracy of these objects measurements and do not calculate the objects distribution on average diameters and persistence lengths.

1120,"Although the construction industry has shown significant improvements in safety performance over the past 30years, falls are still a leading cause of fatalities and serious injuries. Previous studies have focused on identifying factors affecting the risk of falls, but remained silent on investigating the evidential relationships among these factors to better prevent fall accidents. This research proposes a Bayesian network (BN) based approach to diagnose the accident risk of working at heights. The proposed approach consists of a conceptual and generic model with a protocol for assessing the risk of falls and a computational module. The generic BN model was developed on the basis of an extensive review and evaluation of causal factors leading to falls. The computational module was developed on the basis of Bayes' rule for inference to customize model input and job site characteristics. The results of the proposed approach provide probabilities associated with different states of safety risk. Additionally, sensitivity analysis allows practitioners to identify appropriate preventive actions and safety strategies to reduce risk of fall. The proposed approach was verified and tested with a construction operation in a condo-hotel project. This study contributes to the construction safety body of knowledge by providing an effective quantitative risk assessment tool to predict the safety risk of falls from heights. Researchers and practitioners may customize the model to assess and benchmark the fall risk for different operations in the construction industry.

Study of PTOA is typically performed in vivo with replicate animals using artificially induced injury features. The goal of this work was to measure changes in a joint contact stress in the knee of a large quadruped after creation of a clinically realistic overload injury and a focal cartilage defect. Whole-joint overload was achieved by excising a 5-mm wedge of the anterior medial meniscus. Focal cartilage defects were created using a custom pneumatic impact gun specifically developed and mechanically characterized for this work. To evaluate the effect of these injuries on joint contact mechanics, Tekscan (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA) measurements were obtained pre-operatively, postmeniscectomy, and postimpact (1.2-J) in a nonrandomized group of axially loaded cadaveric sheep knees. Postmeniscectomy, peak contact stress in the medial compartment is increased by 71% (p = 0.03) and contact area is decreased by 35% (p = 0.001); the center of pressure (CoP) shifted toward the cruciate ligaments in both the medial (p = 0.004) and lateral (p = 0.03) compartments.

This gives users many choices of visualization techniques to gain an insight about the dataset at hand.

The work presented here introduces a set of visualization metrics to quantify visualization techniques. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we propose effectiveness, expressiveness, readability, and interactivity as the visualization metrics. Using these metrics, a framework for optimizing the layout of a visualization technique is also presented. The framework is based on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) which uses treemaps as a case study. The EA starts with a randomly initialized population, where each chromosome of the population represents one complete treemap. Using the genetic operators and the proposed visualization metrics as an objective function, the EA finds the optimum visualization layout. The visualizations that evolved are compared with the state-of-the-art treemap visualization tool through a user study. The user study utilizes benchmark tasks for the evaluation. A comparison is also performed using direct assessment, where internal and external visualization metrics are used. Results are further verified using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The results suggest better performance of the proposed metrics and the EA-based framework for optimizing visualization layout.

Main memory databases can benefit from their nice features, such as their low leakage power and nonvolatility, the high density of PCM, the good read performance and low read energy consumption of STT-RAM, and the low cost of ReRAM's crossbar architecture. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as their long write latency, high write energy, and limited lifetime, which bring challenges to database algorithm design for NVM-based memory systems. In this paper, we focus on the design of the ubiquitous B+-tree, aiming to make it NVM-friendly. We present a basic cost model for NVM-based memory systems which distinguishes writes from reads, and propose detailed CPU cost and memory access models for search, insert, and delete operations on a B+-tree. Based on the proposed models, we analyze the CPU costs and memory behaviors of the existing NVM-friendly B+-tree schemes, and find that they suffer from three issues. To address these issues we propose three different schemes. Experimental results show that our schemes can efficiently improve the performance, reduce the memory energy consumption, and extend the lifetime for NVM-based memory systems.

These compounds have been characterized by different physico-chemical and spectroscopic tools (UV Vis, IR, NMR and ESI-Mass). The molecular structure of Iabh is determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction technique. The ligand Iabh displays E-configuration about the >C=N- bond. The structure of ligand is stabilized by intra-molecular H-bonding. In all the metal complexes the ligand coordinates through azomethine-N and carbonyl-O resulting a distorted octahedral geometry for Mn(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) complexes in which chloride ions occupy axial positions. Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes, however, form 4-coordinate distorted square planer and tetrahedral geometry around metal ion, respectively. The structures of the complexes have been satisfactorily modeled by calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT). The corrosion inhibition study of the compounds have been performed against mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 298 M by using weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

These factors include the patient's socio-economic background, age, gender, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings and, in particular, non-adherence versus adherence to therapy. Methods Data were collected from all adult patients admitted to Kalafong Hospital with laboratory confirmed cryptococcal meningitis over a period of 24 months. We analyzed the data by the presentation of descriptive summary statistics, logistic regression was used to assess factors which showed association between outcome of measure and factor. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis using all the factors that showed significant association in the cross tabulation was applied to determine which factors had an impact on the patients' mortality risk. Results A total of 87 patients were identified. All except one were HIV-positive, of which 55.2% were antiretroviral therapy naive. A history of previous tuberculosis was given by 25 patients (28.7%) and 49 (56.3%) were on tuberculosis treatment at admission or started during their hospital stay. In-hospital mortality was 31%. Statistical analysis showed that antiretroviral therapy naive patients had 9.9 (CI 95% 1.2-81.2, p<0.0032) times greater odds of dying compared to those on antiretroviral therapy, with 17 from 48 patients (35.4%) dying compared with 1 out of 21 patients (4.8%) on treatment. Defaulters had 14.7 (CI 95% 1.6-131.6, p<0.016) times greater odds of dying, with 9 from 18 patients dying (50%), compared to the non-defaulters. In addition, patients who presented with nausea and vomiting had a 6.3 (95% CI 1.7-23.1, p<0.005) times greater odds of dying (18/47, 38.3%); this remained significant when adjusted for antiretroviral therapy naive patients and defaulters. Conclusion Cryptococcal meningitis is still a common opportunistic infection in people living with HIV/AIDS resulting in hospitalization and a high mortality. Defaulting antiretroviral therapy and presentation with nausea and vomiting were associated with a significantly increased mortality risk.

The watermark has been embedded in intermediate significant bit planes besides the least significant bit plane at the address locations determined by pseudorandom address vector (PAV). The watermark embedding using PAV makes it difficult for an adversary to locate the watermark and hence adds to security of the system. The scheme has been evaluated to ascertain the spatial locations that are robust to various image processing and geometric attacks JPEG compression, additive white Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, filtering and rotation. The experimental results obtained, reveal an interesting fact, that, for all the above mentioned attacks, other than rotation, higher the bit plane in which watermark is embedded more robust the system. Further, the perceptual quality of the watermarked images obtained in the proposed system has been compared with some state-of-art watermarking techniques. The proposed technique outperforms the techniques under comparison, even if compared with the worst case peak signal-to-noise ratio obtained in our scheme.

1143,"Ablation strategies targeting areas of complex fractionated atrial electrograms are not successful for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Fractionation of atrial electrograms may have multiple causes of both pathologic and nonpathologic origin. In order to gain insight into the definitions used for determining areas of fractionation, a literature search was performed using a systematic approach. A PubMed search for studies describing fractionation during human atrial electrophysiologic measurements resulted in 348 articles that were screened for new definitions of fractionation. The 24studies remaining after screening described 11 different visual definitions for fractionation, 3 automated complex fractionated atrial electrogram detection programs, and 7 new parameters for measuring fractionation. Five different definitions for continuous electrical activity were presented. Electrode properties were often not described, and endocardial bipolar recordings in recent studies used electrode diameters ranging from 1 to 8 mm with interelectrode distance of 2-5 mm. In summary, no uniform definition or recording method is used for measuring fractionation of cardiac atrial electrograms. The different electrophysiologic causes of fractionation and the influence of recording device properties on fractionation complicate identification of true pathologic inhomogeneous conduction. The first step in discrimination between origins of fractionation may be accomplished by relating electrogram morphology to spatial patterns of activation. Before revisiting ablation of areas with fractionated electrograms, we need to determine the correct method for identifying pathologic fractionation.

1144,"Among uncertain graph queries, reachability, i.e., the probability that one vertex is reachable from another, is likely the most fundamental one. Although this problem has been studied within the field of network reliability, solutions are implemented on a single computer and can only handle small graphs. However, as the size of graph applications continually increases, the corresponding graph data can no longer fit within a single computer's memory and must therefore be distributed across several machines. Furthermore, the computation of probabilistic reachability queries is #P-complete making it very expensive even on small graphs. In this paper, we develop an efficient distributed strategy, called DistR, to solve the problem of reachability query over large uncertain graphs. Specifically, we perform the task in two steps: distributed graph reduction and distributed consolidation. In the distributed graph reduction step, we find all of the maximal subgraphs of the original graph, whose reachability probabilities can be calculated in polynomial time, compute them and reduce the graph accordingly. After this step, only a small graph remains. In the distributed consolidation step, we transform the problem into a relational join process and provide an approximate answer to the #P-complete reachability query. Extensive experimental studies show that our distributed approach is efficient in terms of both computational and communication costs, and has high accuracy.

1147,"According to many published literature, parallel computing is regarded as an efficient solution in digital terrain analysis (DTA) of geographic information system. The stable and credible services play an irreplaceable role in the high performance computing, especially when an error occurs in large-scale science computing. In this paper, a new approach for the parallel DTA considering the performance of fault-tolerance was proposed: fast parallel re-computation (FPR). FPR owns a fast self-recovery ability based on redundancy mechanisms compared to other fault-tolerant methods. Once some errors in application layers are detected, the data block having computation errors is further partitioned into several sub-blocks, which are re-computed by the surviving processes concurrently to improve the efficiency of failure recovery. The overlapping strategy of error detection and re-computation is presented through decomposing the data block into several logic sub-blocks. As a result, when an error of a logical sub-block of the data block is detected by a comparing thread the re-computing process immediately starts to correct the error. This strategy reduces the time of re-computation and error detection by overlapping them comparing the traditional re-computation method. The experiments show that the proposed FPR method can achieve better performance efficiency with fewer overhead.

1148,"A novel system decoupling approach (SDA) that enables three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) bridge flutter analysis is proposed in this study to simultaneously investigate the relationships between modal parameters and 18 flutter derivatives. Based on the incentive-feedback mechanisms, the aerodynamic coupled system is conveniently decoupled in an iterative solution. Based on the SDA, it is unnecessary to simultaneously calculate all multiple frequencies for determining modal parameters and eventually quantifying critical flutter wind velocity. The efficacy and accuracy of the SDA is verified using a numerical example of thin flat plate. The coupling effects among three DOFs and influence of 18 flutter derivatives on flutter performance are quantified using the newly proposed method. The flutter mechanisms of thin flat plate and bluff deck section of the Akashi Kaikyo Suspension Bridge are numerically examined, and both difference and common grounds for two typical flutter phenomena are summarized. The results by the SDA show good agreement with those by the commonly used complex eigen-value analysis (CEVA). For the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge with bluff deck section, the analytical results of 2-DOF coupled flutter are coincident with the 3-DOF case and the experimental observations. This study provides significant insights into the flutter characteristics of 3-DOF bridges and explores the roles played by various parameters in modifying bridge deck aerodynamics and the evolution of modal coupling with increasing wind velocity. The simplified formulation that only concerns is presented, by which acceptable accuracy of flutter parameters can also be achieved for torsional modal branch. It is validated using a thin flat plate and the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge with bluff deck.

Early-life adversity increases the risk of developing a number of disorders, such as chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Although much of the research has examined the impact of physical maltreatment, an increasing number of studies have been published over the past few years examining the effect of childhood psychological stress and trauma on the development of various types of chronic pain conditions. We review the clinical and preclinical data examining the link among early-life psychological stress, altered nociceptive behavior, and chronic pain in later life. Evidence supporting a role for certain key neurobiological substrates, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; monoaminergic, opioidergic, endocannabinoid and immune systems; and epigenetic mechanisms in the association between early-life psychological stress and chronic pain, is provided. Greater understanding of the impact of early-life stress may inform the development of personalized treatments for chronic pain in later life and strategies to prevent its onset in susceptible individuals.

1151,"Age-related changes in brain structure are a question of interest to a broad field of research. Structural decline has been consistently, but not unambiguously, linked to functional consequences, including cognitive impairment and dementia. One of the areas considered of crucial importance throughout this process is the medial temporal lobe, and primarily the hippocampal region. Gender also has a considerable effect on volume deterioration of subcortical grey matter ( GM) structures, such as the hippocampus. The influence of agexgender interaction on disproportionate GM volume changes might be mediated by hormonal effects on the brain. Hippocampal volume loss appears to become accelerated in the postmenopausal period. This decline might have significant influences on neuroplasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus highly vulnerable to pathological influences. Additionally, menopause has been associated with critical pathobiochemical changes involved in neurodegeneration. The micro-and macrostructural alterations and consequent functional deterioration of critical hippocampal regions might result in clinical cognitive impairment-especially if there already is a decline in the cognitive reserve capacity. Several lines of potential vulnerability factors appear to interact in the menopausal period eventually leading to cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease. This focused review aims to delineate the influence of unmodifiable risk factors of neurodegenerative processes, i.e., age and gender, on critical subcortical GM structures in the light of brain derived estrogen effects. The menopausal period appears to be of key importance for the risk of cognitive decline representing a time of special vulnerability for molecular, structural, and functional influences and offering only a narrow window for potential protective effects.

Here, we selected cysteine-arginine-glutamic acid-lysine-alanine (CREKA) as the fibrin clot-binding peptide and designed 2 types of fusion proteins for tumor targeting. The CREKA peptide was fused to IFN gamma's C-terminus, with or without a matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2)-cleavable linker (IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA or IFN gamma-CREKA, respectively). The former was designed to release IFN gamma from IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA bound to fibrin clots, to ensure IFN gamma's function in the tumor milieu. IFN gamma-activated sequence-dependent reporter gene expression in B16-BL6 cells revealed that the biological activities of IFNg-CREKA and IFN gamma were comparable, whereas that of IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA was approximately 60% that of IFNg. Plasma concentrations of IFN gamma-CREKA and IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA remained at effective levels for at least 4 weeks after gene transfer into mice. After gene transfer to tumor-bearing mice, intratumoral concentration of IFN gamma in pCpG-IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA group was tended to be higher than those of the other groups. Inhibition of colon-26 tumor growth was significantly more with gene transfer of IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA than with IFNg or IFN gamma-CREKA.

1159,"A probabilistic relational database is a probability distribution over a set of deterministic relational databases (namely, possible worlds). Efficient updating information in probabilistic databases is required in several applications, such as sensor networking and data cleaning. As a way to update a probabilistic database, conditioning refines the probability distribution of the possible worlds based on general knowledge, such as functional dependencies. The existing methods for conditioning are exponential over the number of variables in the probabilistic database for an arbitrary constraint. In this paper, a constraint-based conditioning framework is proposed, which solves the conditioning problem by considering only the variables in the given constraint. Then, we prove the correctness of our proposed approach and provide efficient algorithms for each step of the approach. Afterward, a pruning strategy that can significantly improve the efficiency of the constraint-based approach is proposed for the functional dependency constraints. Furthermore, for functional dependency constraints, a variable-elimination strategy that minimizes the number of generated variables can benefit the subsequent query processing. The experimental study shows that the constraint based approach is more efficient than other approaches described in the literature. The effectiveness of the two optimization strategies for functional dependency constraints is also demonstrated in the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

METHODS Patients who have undergone a lactulose or glucose hydrogen breath test to rule out small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) for various clinical symptoms, including diarrhoea, weight loss, abdominal pain, cramping or bloating, were seen as eligible for inclusion in a retrospective single-centre study. Clinical data such as co-morbidities, medication, laboratory parameters and other possible risk factors have been identified from the electronic data system. Cases lacking or with substantially incomplete clinical data were excluded from the analysis. Suspected contributors were summarised under four different pathophysiological pathways (impaired gastric acid barrier, impaired intestinal clearance, immunosuppression and miscellaneous factors including thyroid gland variables) and investigated using the chi(2) test, Student's t-test and logistic regression models. RESULTS A total of 1809 patients who had undergone hydrogen breath testing were analysed. Impairment of the gastric acid barrier (gastrectomy, odds ratio: OR = 3.5, PPI therapy OR = 1.4), impairment of intestinal clearance (any resecting gastric surgery OR = 2.6, any colonic resection OR = 1.9, stenosis OR = 3.4, gastroparesis OR = 3.4, neuropathy 2.2), immunological factors (any drug-induced immunosuppression OR = 1.8), altered thyroid gland metabolism (hypothyroidism OR = 2.6, levothyroxine therapy OR = 3.0) and diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.9) were associated significantly to SIBO. Any abdominal surgery, ileocecal resection, vagotomy or IgA-deficiency did not have any influence, and a history of appendectomy decreased the risk of SIBO. Multivariate analysis revealed gastric surgery, stenoses, medical immunosuppression and levothyroxine to be the strongest predictors. Levothyroxine therapy was the strongest contributor in a simplified model (OR = 3.0). CONCLUSION The most important contributors for the development of SIBO in ascending order are immunosuppression, impairment of intestinal clearance and levothyroxine use, but they do not sufficiently explain its emergence.

This study evaluated whether this substitution effect of MC for opioids also applies to other psychoactive medications. New England dispensary members (n = 1,513) completed an online survey about their medical history and MC experiences. Among respondents that regularly used opioids, over three-quarters (76.7%) indicated that they reduced their use since they started MC. This was significantly (p < 0.0001) greater than the patients that reduced their use of antidepressants (37.6%) or alcohol (42.0%). Approximately two-thirds of patients decreased their use of anti-anxiety (71.8%), migraine (66.7%), and sleep (65.2%) medications following MC which significantly (p < 0.0001) exceeded the reduction in antidepressants or alcohol use.

Capacitor mismatch and finite gain of the operational amplifier (OPAMP) can be overcome by the proposed calibration method. Given that the capacitor mismatch and the finite OPAMP gain cause the radix of all the stages of 1.5 bit/stage pipeline ADC to become unequal to 2, the FFT processor can be adopted to evaluate the actual radixes of all the stages and then generate new digital output to compensate for error caused by these non-ideal effects. Moreover, as capacitor mismatch and the finite gain of OPAMP can be compensated, low-gain OPAMP can be used in high-performance ADC to reduce power dissipation; a small capacitor can then be adopted to save on space. An example of a 10 bit 1.5 bit/stage pipelined ADC with only an 8 bit circuit performance is implemented in 0.18 mu m TSMC CMOS process.

For hardware implementation, a 8-bit ATmega microcontroller is used and interfaced with the simulated power system model using Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The scheme is tested on a power system model of 400 kV, 50 Hz three phase double circuit line with source at both the ends. Laboratory tests have been performed in real time for 20,000 fault cases including evolving faults with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, direction of power flow angle and its magnitude. The tests confirm the suitability and reliability of proposed scheme even with Current Transformer (CT) saturation. The implementation of the proposed approach on a low cost microcontroller with the lesser execution time, makes the prototype ideal for implementation on a digital platform (digital relay), thus leading to financial viability and sustainability of the protection scheme.

1169,"An intensification of agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado during the last four decades has resulted in unintended consequences such as increased groundwater and surface water pollution due to excessive N fertilization. To address these problems within a coffee (Coffea arabica L.) orchard, the process-based ANIMO model was used to simulate nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching and plant nitrogen (N) uptake for several rates of N (200-800 kg h(-1) y(-1)). Effects of splitting N applications from three times per year to every other day were also evaluated for a Typic Hapludox within the Cerrado. Statistical analysis of ANIMO outputs showed that simulated soil solution NO3-N concentrations were in agreement with experimental measurements collected for an entire year. Simulated annual N uptake was also in agreement with average measured N uptake by the coffee plants. An evaluation of the simulation scenarios showed that: i) the most efficient N recovery was associated with N rates between 200 and 400 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) that were split into at least seven applications per year; ii) N recovery at rates between 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) were efficient with or without split application; and iii) the most environmentally friendly N management strategy was the application of between 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) using at least seven splits. Reducing the N rate from 600 to 400 kg N ha (-1) y(-1) increased plant N recovery efficiency by 8-12% and reduced NO3-N leaching by 28 to 47%. Predicted NO3-N leaching and N plant uptake results confirm that better N management strategies can be developed for coffee plantations and other crops grown in the Cerrado. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

1171,"1. INTRODUCTION Sustainability has been defined as the need to preserve existing natural resources so that the earth is able to continue to provide these resources for future generations. Put more simply, a sustainable system is one that survives or persists (Costanza and Patten, 1995). In order to ensure the sustainability of architectural and building activity, it is essential that work in this field is conducted in accordance with the canons of basic ecology and, in addition, that its members seek to address certain cultural and relational characteristics that typify the way we live today. Architecture as a discipline combines technology and art; however, with the advent of ""sustainable architecture"" additional concepts from the fields of ecology, sociology, and philosophy have been incorporated. Yet, the fundamental problem is that the meanings of both the classical and the new concepts remain ambiguous, their significance shifting with our cultural evolution. Hence, the traditional Vitruvian values of architecture (beauty, structure and utility) are no longer so obvious, especially when we are required to think in terms of sustainability. Although the question as to why architecture matters has been answered in a variety of ways (Glaeser, 2011), it is our contention that in the 21st century architecture will matter more than ever, because by 2050 most of the world's population will be concentrated in cities. As a result, the sustainability of dwellings and cities has acquired undeniable importance. Two interacting forces influence all populations. One is the Malthusian dynamic of exponential growth until environmental limits are reached (Figure 1). The second is the Darwinian dynamics of innovation and adaptation that circumvent these limits through biological or cultural evolution. Nekola et al., in 2013 reported that the specific manifestation of these two forces in our current society provide the context that establishes how humans may develop sustainable relationships within our finite planet (Figure 2). Consequently, a permanent and indefinite growth is impossible due to the physical and biological imperatives of our finite world. Biologists and architects and constructors usually inhabit different worlds. The latter innovate, deploy, and apply their techno-science based designs; the first, study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable? In other words, this study aims to elucidate the essence of sustainability in green building design implementation.

1172,"A general synthesis procedure is given for a versatile signal flow graph realization of a general current transfer function by using multi-output second generation current controlled current conveyors (MO-CCCIIs). The proposed configuration uses n + 1 multi-output second generation cur-rent conveyors (MO-CCIIs), n capacitors and at most 2(n + 1) resistors. This number of resistors can be reduced to n for special cases. Using MO-CCCIIs instead of MO-CCIIs, the resistors can be removed completely for the nth-order universal structure. The general transfer function having any numerator dynamics can be derived from the universal structure by using a single MO-CCCII and at most n + I resistors. It is very easy to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized. The validity of the proposed synthesis is verified through PSpice simulations. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

This strain can produce current densities of 843.9 and 865.6 mu A cm(-2) using citrate or acetate as carbon source in a three-electrode configuration. The electricity generation performance was also analyzed in a dual-chamber MFC system, reaching a maximum power density of 1233 mW m(-2). In addition to acetate and citrate, other carbon sources such as pyruvate, formate, acetate, citrate and fumarate could also be utilized to produce current by strain LZ-1. Data supports the presence of electroacfive c-type cytochromes in C. freundii sp. when grown on ITO electrodes, by linking spectroscopy and electrochemistry in situ. Since facultative strains possess many desirable properties compared to anaerobic strains, strain LZ-1 represents a promising exoelectrogenic species in engineering of biological catalysts for microbial electrochemistry.

1175,"Abnormalities in thyroid function are common endocrine disorders that affect 5-10% of the general population, with hypothyroidism occurring more frequently than hyperthyroidism. Clinical symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, particularly in hypothyroidism. Muscular symptoms (stiffness, myalgias, cramps, easy fatigability) are mentioned by the majority of patients with frank hypothyroidism. Often underestimated is the fact that muscle symptoms may represent the predominant or the only clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism, raising the issue of a differential diagnosis with other causes of myopathy, which sometimes can be difficult. Elevated serum creatine kinase, which not necessarily correlates with the severity of the myopathic symptoms, is certainly suggestive of muscle impairment, though it does not explain the cause. Rare muscular manifestations, associated with hypothyroidism, are rhabdomyolysis, acute compartment syndrome, Hoffman's syndrome and Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome. Though the pathogenesis of hypothyroid myopathy is not entirely known, proposed mechanisms include altered glycogenolytic and oxidative metabolism, altered expression of contractile proteins, and neuro-mediated damage. Correlation studies of haplotype, muscle gene expression and protein characterization, could help understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of this myopathic presentation of hypothyroidism.

1177,"A simplified method for measuring the fluidic resistance (R-fluidic) of microfluidic channels is presented, in which the electrical resistance (R-elec) of a channel filled with a conductivity standard solution can be measured and directly correlated to R-fluidic using a simple equation. Although a slight correction factor could be applied in this system to improve accuracy, results showed that a standard voltage meter could be used without calibration to determine R-fluidic to within 12% error. Results accurate to within 2% were obtained when a geometric correction factor was applied using these particular channels. When compared to standard flow rate measurements, such as meniscus tracking in outlet tubing, this approach provided a more straightforward alternative and resulted in lower measurement error. The method was validated using 9 different fluidic resistance values (from similar to 40 to 600 kPa s mm(-3)) and over 30 separately fabricated microfluidic devices. Furthermore, since the method is analogous to resistance measurements with a voltage meter in electrical circuits, dynamic R-fluidic measurements were possible in more complex microfluidic designs. Microchannel R-elec was shown to dynamically mimic pressure waveforms applied to a membrane in a variable microfluidic resistor. The variable resistor was then used to dynamically control aqueous-in-oil droplet sizes and spacing, providing a unique and convenient control system for droplet-generating devices. This conductivity-based method for fluidic resistance measurement is thus a useful tool for static or real-time characterization of microfluidic systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1179,"A power distribution grid exhibits the characteristics of a weak grid owing to the existence of scattered high-power distributed power-generation devices. The grid impedance affects the robust stability of grid-connected inverters, leading to harmonic resonance, or even instability in the system. Therefore, a study of the stability of grid-connected inverters with high grid impedance based on impedance analysis is presented in this paper. The output impedance modeling of an LCL-type single-phase grid-connected inverter is derived, where the effects of the PLL loop and the digital control delays on the output impedance characteristics have been taken into account. To enhance the stability of grid-connected inverters with different grid impedance, a novel impedance-phased compensation control strategy is proposed by increasing the phase margin of the grid-connected inverters. Specifically, a detailed implementation and parameter design of the impedance-phased compensation control method is depicted. Finally, an impedance-phased dynamic control scheme combined with online grid impedance measurement is introduced and also verified by the experiment results.

The important issue in the study of AmI is thinking about context-aware preference. In the context of ubiquitous computing technologies there is not any access for users to the system at one point, but in different contexts. This creates need for context-sensitive preferences. The aim of context reasoning is getting new knowledge, so that systems or services were more intelligent. This process is not a trivial problem, so that we propose multidimensional view on context-aware knowledge for support of contextual reasoning. In this paper we introduce a new TCAP procedure for transformation context-aware preference through OLAP in the AmI. The OLAP technology enables us better analyzing contextual dependence on preferences and choosing relevant content for users in the AmI environment.

The storage unit is made of inert honeycomb supports (cordierite) coated with 88 kg of redox active material (cobalt oxide). An experimental campaign has been carried out consisting of 22 thermochemical charge-discharge cycles. The heat absorbed or released by the chemical reaction became clearly evident through the temperature evolution inside the reactive material. It allows to store or release energy at constant temperature when crossing respectively the reduction/oxidation temperature of the Co3O4/CoO pair. A storage performance factor (P-F) was defined to evaluate how each experiment approaches the ideal behavior. During the complete campaign no measurable cycle-to-cycle degradation was observed and the system average capacity was very close to the ideal case of P-F = 0.84. The advantage of thermochemical storage could be quantified by comparing the storage capacity, to that of a sensible-only storage unit made of uncoated cordierite honeycombs. The thermochemical system offered almost double storage capacity (47.0 kW h) cf. the same volume of the sensible-only case (25.3 kW h). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

So, this water-pond collector works close its maximum efficiency along the day and minimizes nocturnal cooling effect, improving noticeably the performance of the original hose design. As was demonstrated by thermal modeling, this new pulsed-flow design could satisfy the domestic demand of sanitary hot water even in high-latitude locations and furthermore, its performance could be noticeably improved by adding a smart microcontroller.

Using polymerase chain reaction, JAK2 (V617F) mutation was performed in 20 DNA samples from ATL patients and 20 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (control group). The results of ATL subjects and the control group were compared by using SPSS software. In the case group 13 (65 %) and 7 patients (35 %) were male and female respectively, with the age range between 40 and 80 years. Only one patients has JAK2 mutation and this mutation was absent in 95 % of ATL patients as well as the HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers.

The first step is to develop a multi-signal graph model for the object system and generate a dependency matrix as diagnostic knowledge. The second step is to generate conflict sets by the dependency matrix and the system observation vector, and then the problem of finding the minimal diagnosis set is transformed into a problem of integer programming. In the final step, the optimal solution of the problem of integer programming is calculated by using a branch-and-bound algorithm for diagnosis. In this way, explosion problem caused by enumeration can be avoided. In order to facilitate the application of MSFG modeling and on-line diagnosis in real problems, an Intelligent Diagnostic Platform (IDP) that provides a MSFG modeling environment and employs the branch-and-bound algorithm for Complex System diagnosis is developed.

The images confirm that Philae was perched on a sloped surface. A local horizon is visible in one corner of the image, beyond which we can see the coma. Having spent a full day on the surface Philae was commanded to lift and rotate, after which a final, sixth, LED image was acquired. The change in perspective allowed us to construct a shape model of the surface. The distance to the foreground was about 80 cm, much larger than the nominal 30 cm. This caused stray light, rather than directly reflected LED light, to dominate the image signal, complicating the analysis. The images show a lumpy surface with a roughness of apparently fractal nature. Its appearance is completely different from that of the first landing site, which was characterized by centimeter to meter-sized debris (Mottola et al., 2015). We recognize neither particles nor pores at the image resolution of 0.8 mm per pixel and large color variations are absent. The surface has a bi-modal brightness distribution that can be interpreted in terms of the degree of consolidation, a hypothesis that we support with experimental evidence.

Only a small number of these patients suffer from classical hypogonadism as a result of recognizable hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology. The cut-off value of the serum testosterone level in men without obvious hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology is controversial. It is unclear to what extent a low serum testosterone level causally leads to type2 diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome. From a theoretical standpoint, there can be complex interactions among the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, body composition and insulin resistance, which can be further influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors to give rise to metabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, and low-grade inflammation to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although a low serum testosterone level frequently coexists with cardiometabolic risk factors and might serve as a biomarker, more studies are required to clarify the causal, mediating or modifying roles of low serum testosterone level in the development of adverse clinical outcomes. Currently, there are insufficient randomized clinical trial data to evaluate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on meaningful clinical outcomes. The risk-to-benefit ratio of testosterone therapy in high-risk subjects, such as those with type2 diabetes, also requires elucidation. The present article aims to review the current evidence on low serum testosterone levels in patients with type2 diabetes, and its implications on cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome and adverse clinical outcomes.

In the absence of sensor noise/static load disturbances, an autonomous relay control system with an asymmetrical relay induces a smooth limit cycle at the process output. Dynamic model parameters are estimated using the set of proposed expressions which depend on the parameters of limit cycle output and its derivatives. However, in practice, the process output is generally corrupted by the measurement noise, thereby rendering an erroneous identification of process dynamics. Furthermore, static load disturbance during an identification test also induces an asymmetrical limit cycle output resulting in inaccurate measurements. Hence, a fast Fourier transform technique and biased relay feedback methods are implemented to obviate the problem of asymmetries and chattering in the limit cycle output yielding the original limit cycle and its subsequent derivatives. The proposed method has been validated, considering five typical examples from literature.

METHODS The in vitro antioxidant effect of CDAE was investigated using alpha, alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), beta-carotene bleaching, reducing power, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assays. A linoleic acid system, including ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assays, was used to evaluate the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of CDAE against CCl4-induced liver damage were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Silymarin was used as a positive control. Liver damage was assessed by determining hepatic histopathology and liver marker enzymes in serum. Enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant levels and lipid peroxide content were measured in the liver. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) protein expression was measured via immunohistochemical staining. Nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalytic subunit (gamma-GCSc) protein expression was measured by Western blot. RESULTS Our results showed that CDAE exhibited a strong antioxidant activity in vitro. CDAE scavenged DPPH and ABTS radicals in a dose-dependent manner. CDAE inhibited lipid peroxidation with a lipid peroxide inhibition rate of 40.6% +/- 5.2%. In the FTC and TBA assays, CDAE significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation (P < 0.01). In vivo histopathological studies indicated that CCl4-induced liver injury was alleviated following CDAE treatment in rats of both sexes. CDAE (160 and 320 mg/kg) significantly prevented CCl4-induced elevations of alkaline phosphatase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels in rats of both sexes (P < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001). Moreover, CDAE restored the decreased activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as non-enzyme antioxidant glutathione, which were induced by CCl4 treatment. CDAE significantly suppressed the up-regulation of CYP2E1 and promoted Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and gamma-GCSc protein expression. CONCLUSION CDAE exhibits good antioxidant performance in vitro, with marked radical-scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. CDAE is effective in preventing CCl4-induced hepatic damage in rats of both sexes. The hepatoprotective activity of CDAE may be attributable to its antioxidant activity, which may involve Keap1-Nrf2-mediated antioxidant regulation.

The future will therefore probably bring us fundamental questions: What will it mean for Bitcoin network, if the real costs of running the network will be reflected in costs of transaction? How will Bitcoin network be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies, whose operation is carried out at a much lower cost? Will halving mechanism ultimately cause a declined hash rate, and thereby also a reduction in network security?

1199,"Active cancellation stealth is a significant developing direction in modern stealth technology field. In this paper, according to characteristics of linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal and nonlinear frequency modulated (NLFM) signal, the cancellation signal was designed. An important parameter called cancellaty which is used to measure the effect of cancellation is proposed. The basic theory of active cancellation stealth is introduced. Based on radar target fluctuation models, the formulas of the radar detection probability are given. Combining the definition of cancellaty with radar detection probability, the effective scope of the cancellaty is ensured. Simulation results show the effectiveness and the practicability of active cancellation.

1200,"A substantial gap remains between what we know about type 2 diabetes prevention and our ability to apply that knowledge in socially disadvantaged populations at highest risk. This gap results, in part, from a lack of integration between epidemiologic science and social psychology theory, particularly regarding the intersections of stress, self-regulatory health behaviors, and the biological mechanisms underlying the development of diabetes. In this commentary, we describe the utility of a theoretical framework that focuses on the intersection of biological, psychosocial, and environmental contexts as they apply to diabetes disparities, and how such a framework could inform a translational research agenda to reorient prevention efforts to address these inequalities. Such reorientation is needed to ensure that the implementation of prevention efforts does not inadvertently widen diabetes disparities.

1202,"A diet low in poorly absorbed, fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) is an effective strategy to manage symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet has gained traction since its original description in Australia 10 years ago and is now an internationally accepted dietary management strategy for IBS. Randomized controlled trials have raised the profile of the low-FODMAP diet to become a viable first-line therapy for IBS, when implemented under a dietitian's guidance. Importantly, the diagnosis of IBS should be confirmed before commencement of the dietary approach. The skill set of the dietitian is then paramount to the success of the diet. Experience in gastrointestinal disorder management, consideration of symptom types, severity, baseline FODMAP intake, and overall nutritional content and meal pattern are vital in the assessment of the patient. If a strict low-FODMAP diet is deemed necessary, it should only be for an initial period of 4 to 6 weeks. Research suggests that a strict long-term, low-FODMAP diet may negatively impact intestinal microbiome. After the initial strict period, follow up with the dietitian should be conducted to achieve the overall goal-a relaxed FODMAP restriction that enables inclusion of prebiotic FODMAPs while still maintaining symptom relief. The diet will be effective in the vast majority of patients. For those in which it fails, FODMAPs should be reintroduced to the diet, and other dietary (or non-dietary) approaches should be considered.

1203,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are regarded as promising therapeutic agents to treat addiction. The current study aimed to examine the effects of huperzine A, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on behavioral sensitization induced by repeated morphine administration and relapse induced by contextual conditioning. The present study also assessed whether the state-dependency hypothesis may explain the results. Adult rats were divided into four groups (n=8) and intraperitoneally injected with 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A or saline (1 ml/kg, control), for 5 days. The effect of repeated huperzine A administration alone on locomotor activity was assessed. For the experiments that analyzed the development of morphine-induced sensitization, 40 rats were divided into five groups (n=8): Saline+Saline, Saline+Morphine, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A+Morphine. Following a withdrawal period of 7 days, all animals were administered saline or morphine, as appropriate. To test the state-dependency hypothesis, the rats in the Saline+Morphine group were injected with saline and morphine, while the other three groups were administered different doses of huperzine A and morphine. To examine the effect of huperzine A on the expression of morphine-induced sensitization, the rats in huperzine A+Morphine groups were injected with appropriate concentrations of huperzine A, and morphine. The current results indicated that the administration of huperzine A alone did not affect locomotor activity, while higher doses of huperzine A inhibited the addictive behavior induced by morphine at the development phase. Additionally, huperzine A administration during the expression phase of morphine sensitization did not inhibit the relapse induced by administration of saline. Furthermore, 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A inhibited the expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. Therefore, the results of the current study do not support the state-dependency hypothesis.

1205,"Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) is becoming an epidemic problem in our society, especially among older adults, being known as ""the Silent Epidemic"". People with ABI demand solutions in research that offer them with a relearning process such that they can recover not only their physical skills but also their cognitive abilities. In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the explbitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare Aml systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited. Finally, how this system is used to both design and execute therapies for people with ABI is presented.

1207,"A fully geometrically nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed using large rotation shell theory for static analysis of composite and piezoelectric laminated thin-walled structures. The proposed large rotation theory is based on the first-order shear deformation (FOSD) hypothesis. It has six independent kinematic parameters which are expressed by five mechanical nodal degrees of freedom (DOFs). Linear electro-mechanically coupled constitutive equations with a constant electric field distribution through the thickness of each smart material layer are considered. Eight-node quadrilateral plate/shell elements with five mechanical DOFs per node and one electrical DOF per smart material layer are employed in the FE modeling. The present large rotation FE model is implemented into static analysis of both composite and piezoelectric laminated plates and shells. The equilibrium equation is solved by Newton-Raphson algorithm with system matrices updated in every iteration. The results are compared with those presented in the literature and others calculated by various simplified nonlinear shell theories. They indicate that large rotation theory has to be considered for the calculation of displacements and sensor output voltages of smart structures undergoing large deflections, since other simplified nonlinear theories fail to predict the static response precisely in many cases.

1208,"Accessible summary What is known on the subject? There is a growing emphasis on communication as a result of the move towards the more inclusive approach associated with the community-based rehabilitation model. Therefore, more importance is attached to handovers. Besides ensuring transfer of information, handovers enhance group cohesion, socialize staff members to the practices of the service and capture its organizational culture. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? While handovers are mainly used for information transfer and to manage the services' daily routine, this paper offers an insight on how handovers can be conceived as valuable instruments to document cultural and organizational change. Only a limited amount of studies has focused on handovers in mental healthcare settings, and most of them only consider the perspectives of psychiatric nurses, while embracing a broader perspective, this paper provides valuable insights into the perspectives of various service providers. The overcoming of the dichotomy deficit-based vs. recovery-oriented model is possible if professionals use handovers to reflect upon their practice and the ways in which their cultural models are affected by the environmental context. What are the implications for practice? Handovers are valuable instruments to document organizational change. It would be important for psychiatric and rehabilitation facilities to keep track of the handover records over time as they may provide insightful information about cultural change and the transformations in the core values and beliefs held by professionals. Abstract Handovers assure a timely and correct information transfer while socializing workers to the service's culture; however, no study describes them as instruments to document organizational change and only a few have focused on psychiatric settings. Aim To investigate the change in the culture of an Italian psychiatric residential care home as perceived by its mental health workers (MHWs) over the course of two decades. Method Emotional text analysis (ETA) was used to analyse the MHWs' handovers completed from 1990 to 2011. Results The analysis generated four clusters and three main factors illustrating the change in the MHWs' representations of the residential care home and its occupants. The factors showed: (1) the shift from an individualistic, problem-focused view to an inclusive, community-based approach; (2) the presence of a descriptive as well as a specialized language; and (3) the presence of a double focus: on patients and professionals. Conclusions Handovers transcripts document the following changes: (1) a shift from a symptom-based to a recovery-oriented approach; (2) a modification of the MHWs values towards an holistic view of the patient; (3) a growing importance assigned to accountability, services integration and teamwork. The paper shows that handovers can be used diachronically to document organizational change.

1209,"Alignment-free methods are one of the mainstays of biological sequence comparison, i.e., the assessment of how similar two biological sequences are to each other, a fundamental and routine task in computational biology and bioinformatics. They have gained popularity since, even on standard desktop machines, they are faster than methods based on alignments. However, with the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies, datasets whose size, i.e., number of sequences and their total length, is a challenge to the execution of alignment-free methods on those standard machines are quite common. Here, we propose the first paradigm for the computation of k-mer-based alignment-free methods for Apache Hadoop that extends the problem sizes that can be processed with respect to a standard sequential machine while also granting a good time performance. Technically, as opposed to a standard Hadoop implementation, its effectiveness is achieved thanks to the incremental management of a persistent hash table during the map phase, a task not contemplated by the basic Hadoop functions and that can be useful also in other contexts.

The area under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristic curve for prognostic predictor in NSCLC was 0.817 at 2000 days of overall survival which were also over 0.8 in LUAD and LUSC, separately. Interestingly, splicing correlation networks uncovered opposite roles of splicing factors in LUAD and LUSC. We created prognostic predictors based on alternative splicing events with high performances for risk stratification in NSCLC patients and uncovered interesting splicing networks in LUAD and LUSC which could be underlying mechanisms.

The objectives of this study were to confirm the outbreak and identify the aetiology, source and transmission patterns. All residents and staff in or near the nursing home during the period from 1 October 2014 to 21 May 2015 were investigated regarding hygiene and for epidemiological information including water and food (eating meat especially pork products). Serum and stool specimens were collected for detection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies using ELISA and RNA using RT-PCR. Samples that were RNA positive were genotyped. Of 185 senior residents and 24 staff in the nursing home, there were 37 laboratory-confirmed cases during the outbreak. Of these cases, 12 patients (three deaths) were symptomatic with jaundice, a common clinical symptom for hepatitis E infection. HEV strains were isolated from three cases and they formed a single cluster within genotype 4d. A case-control study was conducted to investigate potential risk factors for the outbreak and the results revealed that cases more often washed their dishes and rinsed their mouths using tap water than the controls (P < 0.05). Based on hygiene investigation and meteorological information, it is likely that HEV-infected sewage and faeces contaminated the water network on rainy days. Collectively, these results suggest that the outbreak of HEV genotype 4 infection was most likely caused by contaminated tap water rather than food.

1217,"A controversy arose decades ago whether the DG42 gene product expressed during frog embryogenesis synthesized hyaluronan or chitin. Both sets of investigators were correct. It is now possible to understand how prescient those findings were. Synthesis of a seven to nine chitin sugar chain fragment is required before hyaluronan synthesis begins. Thus, DG42 indeed synthesizes both hyaluronan and chitin. Hyaluronan turns over rapidly in vertebrate tissues, but chitin oligomers are difficult to degrade. They accumulate and can cause pathology. Chitin is a simple beta-linked repeating sugar homopolymer found prominently in the building block structures of fungi, molluscs, arthropods, and other forms of invertebrate life. It is a highly resistant insoluble material requiring chitin synthases for production and chitinases for degradation. Mysteriously, chitins and chitinases also occur in vertebrate tissues, while it had previously been assumed that no chitins were contained therein. That assumption is now challenged based on recent biochemical evidence. Chitin does accumulate in many tissues, but may be particularly toxic to neurons. Its accumulation in the brain may account for the cognitive decline found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The DG42 observations together with the participation of chitins and chitinases in several human diseases, among which in addition to Alzheimer's disease include Gaucher's disease, asthma, and aspects of abnormal immune recognition justify a reexamination of these topics. The purpose of this review is to summarize data in order to place chitins and their attendant enzymes in a rational framework in an attempt to create a cohesive story.

This study presents the preliminary results of the assessment of several spectral indices to evaluate the burn severity of Madeira fires during August 2016. These spectral indices were calculated using the new European satellite Sentinel-2A launched in June 2015. The study confirmed the advantages of several spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIreXn) using red-edge spectral bands to assess the post-fire conditions. Results showed high correlation between NDVI, GNDVI, NBR and NDVIreln spectral indices and the analysis performed by Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMSR175), considered as the reference truth. Regarding the red-edge spectral indices, the NDVIreln (using band B5, 705 nm) presented better results compared with B6 (740 nm) and B7 (783 nm) bands. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for post-fire monitoring. In the future, the two twin Sentinel-2 satellites will offer global coverage of the Madeira Archipelago every five days, therefore allowing the simultaneous study of the evolution of the burnt area and reforestation information with high spatial (up to 10 m) and temporal resolution (5 days).

Settlement of bridge approach slabs and their supporting backfill has been reported by more than ten Departments of Transportation throughout the United States. According to current Wyoming Department of Transportation inspection reports, bridge approach slab settlements occurred not only on existing bridges but also on newly built bridges that were recently opened to traffic. These settlements typically create voids ranging from 150 mm to 305 mm (6-12 in.) between the base of the approach slab and the geotextile reinforced backfill. This research presents factors causing bridge approach slab settlements and provides appropriate design and construction recommendations. A comprehensive literature review pertaining to approach slabs was performed to examine outcomes of research conducted by 12 states. The current specifications and standards on bridge approach slabs of the corresponding states' Departments of Transportation were also evaluated. A nationwide survey was conducted to fill in the missing knowledge identified in the literature review. The results of the survey are categorized into three groups based on the percentage of bridges experiencing approach slab settlements in that state. Results of the survey show that 46% of the total 28 states are not satisfied with their current approach slab designs. The survey results revealed that the most common cause of approach slab settlement is poor construction practices. The most important finding of the survey is that performing in-situ tests to control backfill compaction reduces the amount of approach slab settlement. Using the lessons learned from the literature and the results of the survey, recommendations were developed for transportation agencies nationwide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By updating, with negligible computation delay, the duty cycle twice in a switching period, the reference current error is nulled in half a modulation period, so that the controller's small-signal bandwidth is maximized. In addition, due to a simple transient detection circuit, the large-signal response delay is reduced to a small fraction of the modulation period, which is determined by the chosen current signal oversampling rate. The controller can effectively support different voltage-source inverter applications, such as active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource controllers, and dc-dc converter applications, including interface converters for renewable energy sources, laboratory battery chargers, and electronic welding machines.

1223,"A systematic and generic procedure for the determination of the reasonable finished state of self-anchored suspension bridges is proposed, the realization of which is mainly through adjustment of the hanger tensions. The initial hanger tensions are first obtained through an iterative analysis by combining the girder-tower-only finite element (FE) model with the analytical program for shape finding of the spatial cable system. These initial hanger tensions, together with the corresponding cable coordinates and internal forces, are then included into the FE model of the total bridge system, the nonlinear analysis of which involves the optimization technique. Calculations are repeated until the optimization algorithm converges to the most optimal hanger tensions (i.e. the desired reasonable finished bridge state). The ""temperature rigid arm"" is introduced to offset the unavoidable initial deformations of the girder and tower, which are due to the huge axial forces originated from the main cable. Moreover, by changing the stiffness coefficient K in the girder-tower-only FE model, the stiffness proportion of the main girder, the tower or the cable subsystem in the whole structural system could be adjusted according to the design intentions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined and demonstrated by one simple tutorial example and one self-anchored suspension bridge.

In this study, we validated the feasibility of utilizing multi-temporal color images acquired from a low altitude UAV-camera system to monitor real-time wheat growth status and to map within-field spatial variations of wheat yield for smallholder wheat growers, which could serve as references for site-specific operations. Firstly, eight orthomosaic images covering a small winter wheat field were generated to monitor wheat growth status from heading stage to ripening stage in Hokkaido, Japan. Multi-temporal orthomosaic images indicated straightforward sense of canopy color changes and spatial variations of tiller densities. Besides, the last two orthomosaic images taken from about two weeks prior to harvesting also notified the occurrence of lodging by visual inspection, which could be used to generate navigation maps guiding drivers or autonomous harvesting vehicles to adjust operation speed according to specific lodging situations for less harvesting loss. Subsequently orthomosaic images were geo-referenced so that further study on stepwise regression analysis among nine wheat yield samples and five color vegetation indices (CVI) could be conducted, which showed that wheat yield correlated with four accumulative CVIs of visible-band difference vegetation index (VDVI), normalized green-blue difference index (NGBDI), green-red ratio index (GRRI), and excess green vegetation index (ExG), with the coefficient of determination and RMSE as 0.94 and 0.02, respectively. The average value of sampled wheat yield was 8.6 t/ha. The regression model was also validated by using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method, of which root-mean-square error of predication (RMSEP) was 0.06. Finally, based on the stepwise regression model, a map of estimated wheat yield was generated, so that within-field spatial variations of wheat yield, which was usually seen as general information on soil fertility, water potential, tiller density, etc., could be better understood for applications of site-specific or variable-rate operations.

Existing 3-D NoCs are inadequate for meeting the ever-increasing performance requirements of many-core processors since they are simple extensions of regular 2-D architectures and they do not fully exploit the advantages provided by 3-D integration. Moreover, the anticipated performance gain of a 3-D NoC-enabled many-core chip may be compromised due to the potential failures of through-silicon-vias that are predominantly used as vertical interconnects in a 3-D IC.

From this, the proposed algorithm achieves robustness against impulsive noise regardless of the convergence state. In addition, the proposed algorithm exhibits a fast convergence rate of the APA for various noise environments. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm adequately combines the advantages of the two component filters for system identification scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1230,"A correspondence is a set of mappings that establishes a relation between the elements of two data structures (i.e. sets of points, strings, trees or graphs). If we consider several correspondences between the same two structures, one option to define a representative of them is through the generalised median correspondence. In general, the computation of the generalised median is an NP-complete task. In this paper, we present two methods to calculate the generalised median correspondence of multiple correspondences. The first one obtains the optimal solution in cubic time, but it is restricted to the Hamming distance. The second one obtains a sub-optimal solution through an iterative approach, but does not have any restrictions with respect to the used distance. We compare both proposals in terms of the distance to the true generalised median and runtime.

And the Unstrained Length Method (ULM), which keeps unstrained lengths of both cable and frame elements constant in the iteration process, is extendedly applied to nonlinear FE analyses of suspension bridges under live load combinations. Finally, one cable without the suspended girder and two earth-anchored suspension bridge models are analytically and numerically solved. And the numerical results are compared to demonstrate accuracy and validity of both the deflection theory and ULM. In particulars, it is emphasized that the load effects of suspension bridges under live loads can be effectively evaluated by applying the semi-linearized theory without relying on nonlinear FE analyses.

1233,"Access to Recovery (ATR) is a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)-funded initiative that offers a mix of clinical and supportive services for substance abuse. ATR clients choose which services will help to overcome barriers in their road to recovery, and a recovery consultant provides vouchers and helps link the client to these community resources. One of ATR's goals was to provide services to those involved in the criminal justice system in the hopes that addressing substance abuse issues could reduce subsequent criminal behaviors. This study examines this goal by looking at recidivism among a sample of clients in one state's ATR program who returned to the community after incarceration. Results suggest that there were few differential effects of service selections on subsequent recidivism. However, there are significant differences in recidivism rates among the agencies that provided ATR services. Agencies with more resources and a focus on prisoner reentry had better recidivism outcomes than those that focus only on substance abuse services.

1234,"A 1 kW scale kite-powered system that uses kites to convert wind energy into electrical energy has been studied to determine its performance characteristics and establish feasibility of steady-state operation. In this kite-powered system, a kite is connected to a tether that transmits the generated aerodynamic forces on the kite to a power conversion system on the ground. The ground-based power conversion system consists of a rocking arm coupled to a Sprag clutch, flywheel, and electrical generator. Governing equations describing the dynamical motion of the kite, tether, and power conversion mechanism were developed assuming an inflexible, straight-line tether. A steady-state analysis of the kite aerodynamics was incorporated into the dynamical equations of the kite-powered system. The governing equations were solved numerically using a Runge-Kutta scheme to assess how performance parameters of the system such as output power, cycle time, and tether tension varied with wind speed, kite area, and aerodynamic characteristics of the kite. The results showed that a 1 kW scale system is feasible using the proposed design concept with a kite area of 25 m(2) and wind speeds of 6 m/s. Preliminary efforts to build and test a working 1 kW scale kite-powered demonstrator are also reported. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4002082]

1235,"A pedestrian suspension bridge over Walker Creek near Route 749 in Giles County, Virginia, partially collapsed in October of 2008, causing 10 people to fall into the creek below. The failure occurred when one of the anchors holding a suspension cable fractured. This paper presents the investigation of the failure, including a structural analysis of the bridge to determine cable forces, material property testing of the fractured anchor, laboratory testing of a different anchor from the bridge, and a simple strength evaluation of the anchor under combined axial force and moment. Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that the anchor should not have failed carrying the loads on the bridge on the day of failure. The anchor failed in brittle fracture because of a local defect in the material at the perimeter of a corrosion pit on the surface of the anchor hook. The structural analysis and laboratory testing indicated that the material around the defect was at yield before fracture initiation. The material flaws significantly influenced the bridge failure after yielding and inelastic deformation of the anchor material at the inside of the hook radius occurred.

1236,"A highly reconfigurable merged analog baseband (MABB) with not only tunable bandwidth (BW), gain, and order but also reconfigurable power, noise, and linearity is proposed for multistandard integrated wireless receivers in this brief. The MABB could arrange the total gain to different stages for noise and linearity tradeoffs by introducing the merged biquad topology. To save power, the operational amplifier (Opamp) for the proposed MABB can reduce the GBW, as long as it meets the GBW requirement for different BW, gain, and order. A flexible power-efficient high-GBW Opamp with an adaptive common-mode bias circuit is also proposed for the eighth-order active-RC MABB. The proposed MABB covers a cutoff frequency range from 200 kHz to 20 MHz, whereas the gain could be tuned between 0 and 72 dB. The proposed highly reconfigurable MABB is suitable for multistandard integrated wireless receivers.

1237,"A rapid prototyping methodology for digital controllers is presented in this paper. Its main application is in the development, debugging, and test of microgrid inverter controllers. To fulfill the application requirements, these systems are characterized by complex multilayer architectures, extending from pulse width modulation (PWM) and current control loops up to global optimization and high level communication functions. The complexity and the wide variability of the different layer implementations make digital control mandatory. However, developing so complex digital controllers on conventional hardware platforms, like digital signal processors (DSPs) or even FPGAs, is not the most practical choice. This paper shows how multiplatform control devices, where software configurable DSP functions and programmable logic circuits are efficiently combined, represent the optimal solution for this field of application. Furthermore, this paper proposes hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation as an effective means of developing and debugging complex hardware and software codesigned controllers. A case study is presented and used to illustrate the different design and test phases, from initial concept and numerical simulation to final experimental verification.

1238,"Although extensive research has investigated the benefits of green buildings very little is known about user perception and satisfaction. Most of the studies involving users in green buildings are in the form of post-occupancy evaluations that gather satisfaction scores and qualitative feedback from building occupants. However it is difficult to generalize these individual case studies to a wider discussion of preferences for green building attributes. The current research uses a more generalizable technique to examine occupants' experiences in green buildings. This study identifies the relative importance of environmental and experiential design categories by occupants based on lived experiences in the space. The article provides the results of a Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) study that compares responses from green and non-green building occupants. The results provide novel insights into the degree of importance of experiential categories of design, such as social territories, visual, and non-visual aesthetics, compared with environmental categories of design, such as energy efficiency, water savings, and indoor environmental quality. The article contributes to the green building design literature by evaluating green buildings from a new perspective that is based on users' preferences. This perspective can be influential in developing green building rating systems for enhancing green building performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The seawall is located along the 1967-74 erosion scarps and extends for much of the length of the developed shoreline of the Gold Coast. In combination with beach nourishment these terminal seawalls are an integral part of the long-term management of Gold Coast beaches. The standard seawall design and alignment were adopted by the City in the early 1970s with the only structural design change in over 40 years being an option in the 1980's replacing the clay / shale tertiary layer with geotextile. The status investigations were aimed at evaluating the present condition and damage modes of the existing seawalls after long term service. Methods included potholing, Ground Penetrating Radar and excavation / peel back of the armour layers. The review found that the standard seawall designs conformed to present standards but upgrading in the future would be required. Future exposure levels and design conditions were developed along the coastline. It has been concluded that upgrading and completion of a continuous seawall will be required for the future security of Gold Coast beachfront assets. With the uncertainty regarding the rate and extent of changes to sea levels and design wave heights, a staged approach is practical.

It exhibited 5-fold photocurrent enhancement as compared to an un-doped photoelectrode irradiated under simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5G). The photo conversion efficiencies of the electrodes fabricated by variation in the dopant concentration in the range 10(-4)-10(-1)% of Fe have been estimated and compared. The doping enabled to control the charge dynamics in ZnO photoanode to yield enhanced photocurrent. The photo electrochemical hydrogen evolution under solar-photons from the doped photoanode was 17-times larger in magnitude i.e. similar to 307 mu mol/h, than un-doped film electrodes (18 mu mol/h). The film exhibited wurtzite structure (Space Group - P63mc) which did not show any structural lattice deformation after Fe doping of <= 10(-1)%. Optical studies revealed a red-shift in the band-gap, while a decrease in the absorption-coefficient, with the increase in Fe concentration. These photoanodes also displayed higher Incident-Photon-Current-Conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the 400-430 nm wavelength range. Electrochemical studies revealed n-type conductivity of these photoanodes. An anodic shift in the flat-band potential was observed with an increase in the Fe dopant concentration in the ZnO lattice. The result of the experimental study is illustrated in the form of schematic diagram which demonstrates the suitability of the doped system for solar hydrogen generation. Dopant induced improved optical absorption is mainly attributed to the enhancement in photo-response of these Fe doped ZnO films.

The regenerator consists of two parallel delay interferometers followed by balanced detectors, limiting and driving amplifiers, and a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator that regenerates noise-suppressed optical QPSK signals. We experimentally show that the regenerator improves the receiver sensitivity by about 8 dB at an input optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) of 19 dB at a signal speed of 10 Gbaud. Numerical simulation is conducted for higher speed operation at 56 Gbaud to study the impact of the bandwidth of electrical circuits inside the regenerator on the regenerator performance. Electrical power consumption of the regenerator is assessed, and it is shown that the optoelectronic regenerator consumes a similar amount of electrical power as that consumed by an all-optical version of the regenerator using semiconductor optical amplifiers as a nonlinear element.

1246,"A hybrid solar energy conversion system described in this study is designed to exceed the efficiency of each type of technology alone by combining advantages of concentrated solar power (CSP) technology and high performance concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) cells. This hybrid system can be tilted at different inclination angles to track the solar power at different latitudes and different time zones. Thermal management is important to CPV cells, as 1000x concentrated solar radiation onto CPV not only leads to higher performance but also generates more waste heat flux. In this work, the effects of natural convection with and without the interaction of surface radiation in the system consisting of PV cells, optical funnels and a heatsink were numerically investigated with an experimentally validated model. The influence of inclination on the overall flow structure and heat transfer was examined. Under the effect of these funnels, the heat transfer was enhanced when the heat was transferred through PV cells to funnels. At the same time, the separation flow between the spaces of funnels would take the heat to the ambient. The minimum average temperature of surrogate PV cells occurred at the inclination angle of 60Ltd. When the inclination angle varied from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, the stagnation point moved from the downward surface of the heat sink towards the edge of heat sink. From 0 degrees to 60 degrees, the stagnation point was at the downward surface of heat sink and there was a dramatic decrease in the average temperature of the surrogate PV cells. When inclination angles were less than 60 degrees, except that there was a separation region above substrate, the side flow could flow in and out freely between adjacent funnels and then formed a pair of separation bubble, or spiral node, on top of the funnels. At these inclination angles, flow velocity was found to be the dominant factor influencing heat transfer because the flow pattern (separation bubble) was the same on top of the funnels. However, at inclination angles of 60 degrees to 90 degrees the stagnation point occurred at the edge of the heat sink, and the surrogate PV temperature increased. When the inclination angle reached 90, the flow was trapped and recirculated among funnels, and the vortical wake on top of the funnel disappeared. It can be concluded that from 60 degrees to 90 degrees, the dominant factor influencing heat transfer is funnel effect because the flow velocity stayed almost constant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1255,"A very frequently asked question regarding all types of geosynthetics is, ` How long will they last?' This paper answers the question for exposed geotextiles and geomembranes, assuming that they were properly designed and installed. Furthermore, it compares these new results to the earlier lifetime prediction results of a covered geomembrane. Nonexposed (or covered) lifetime conditions for a 1.5 mm thick high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane have previously been evaluated and published. Landfill incubation devices at four elevated temperatures of 85, 75, 65 and 55 degrees C were used in the prediction in order to reach 50% of retained strength and elongation. Considering the three stages of (i) depletion of antioxidants, (ii) induction time, and (iii) 50% reduction in mechanical properties, the lifetime extrapolation was made down to 20 degrees C. The 50% reduction value (called halflife throughout the paper) for this geomembrane under these conditions was approximately 450 years. Since the laboratory incubation times took 12 years, other nonexposed geosynthetics were not evaluated under the supposition that the covered situation is generally a moot point for most geosynthetics in their customary applications. For exposed (or uncovered) geosynthetics, however, the situation is quite different. Ultraviolet radiation, elevated temperature and full oxygen are available, which shortens the service lifetime, but how much? For evaluation of this situation, the authors utilized laboratory ultraviolet fluorescent tube weathering devices, as per ASTM D7238, for incubation purposes. Seven different geotextiles and five different geomembranes were evaluated. Each material was incubated at 80, 70 and 60 degrees C until a 50% reduction of strength and elongation occurred. The data was then extrapolated down to 20 degrees C for laboratory halflife values and for comparison with the nonexposed condition. The ratio of nonexposed to exposed lifetime for HDPE geomembranes is approximately seven. The calculations for the 12 exposed geosynthetics then progressed to using site-specific radiation to obtain an equivalent field halflife. Phoenix, Arizona, conditions are illustrated although the procedure is applicable worldwide. Halflife predictions for the geotextiles vary from a few months for the needle punched nonwovens to up to 10 years for monofilaments and high antioxidant formulated products. Results for geomembranes vary from 47 to 97 years, with HDPE being the highest. These exposed halflife results (which took 12 years of laboratory incubation to achieve) are felt to be most interesting and are presented for the first time to an international audience.

1259,"Accelerating the integration of a joint replacement or the healing of a bone fracture, particularly a complicated non-union fracture, would improve patient welfare and decrease healthcare costs. Currently, an autologous bone graft is the gold standard method for the treatment of complicated non-union fractures, but it is not always possible to harvest such a graft. A proactive highly inductive so-called smart material approach is pertinent in these cases. In this study, the surface chemistry of a previously approved material with desirable bulk material properties was modified to investigate its potential as an economical and effective alternative. The objective was to create stable synthetic chemical coatings that could guide cells along the osteogenic lineage required to generate mineralised tissue that would induce and accelerate bone healing. Primary human osteoblast-like cells were cultured in vitro for 7, 14 and 28 days on amine-terminated (chain length in the range 3-11) silane-modified glass surfaces with controlled nanotopography, to determine how surface chemistry and nanotopography change osteoblast function. The materials were characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle (WCA) and a novel ninhydrin assay. The cells were analysed using qRT-PCR, von Kossa tinctural staining for mineralisation, and visualised using both transmitted white light and electron microscopy. Bone-like nodules, quantified using microscopy, only formed on the short-chain (chain length 3 and 4) amines after 7 days, as did the up-regulation of sclerostin, suggestive of a more mature osteoblast phenotype. In this paper, we report more rapid nodule formation than has previously been observed, without the addition of exogenous factors in the culture medium. This suggests that the coating would improve the integration of implants with bone or be the basis of a smart biomaterial that would accelerate the bone regeneration process.

Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database, we evaluated outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in patients with ANKL. Twenty-one patients with a centrally confirmed diagnosis of ANKL were included. Median patient age was 42 years and 15 patients (71%) were Caucasian. Fourteen patients (67%) were in complete remission (CR) at the time of alloHCT, and 5 patients had active disease. Median follow-up of survivors was 25 months (range, 12 to 116). The 2-year estimates of nonrelapse mortality, relapse/progression, progression free (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 21%, 59%, 20%, and 24%, respectively. The 2-year PFS of patients in CR at the time of alloHCT was significantly better than that of patients with active disease at transplantation (30% versus 0%; P = .001). The 2-year OS in similar order was 38% versus 0% (P < .001). In conclusion, this registry analysis that included majority non-Asian patient population shows that alloHCT can provide durable disease control in a subset of ANKL patients.

Self-assessment measures included the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale for Adolescents (MAAS-A), the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), the modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Child (STAI-C), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Kids version (CERQ-k). Parental assessment measures included the modified STAI-C. The results underlined the program's feasibility and acceptability. Clinical effects of the mindfulness-based program were observed. Self-assessed data for children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group showed increased mindfulness and decreased depression. Reduced anxiety was found in all groups. Positive affect tended to improve from pre-test to post-test in children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group. Parental assessments showed significant improvement in positive affect and decreases in anxiety and negative affect in the intervention group compared to the WLC group. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies were also affected by the mindfulness-based program. Rumination scores significantly decreased from pre-test to post-test in the intervention group. This preliminary study suggests that regular mindfulness practice presents a promising approach to reducing the burden of this neonatal malformation.

1262,"A multiscale approach is pursued to develop a modified shear-lag model for capturing size-scale effects on electrostatic potential generated by a zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire (NW) in a nanocomposite electrical generator (NCEG). The size-scale effect on elastic modulus of ZnO NWs is captured using a core-surface model. Closed form of governing equations is derived considering linear elasticity for axisymmetric problem and cylindrical coordinate system. Two different configurations based on parallel and series connecting of NCEGs for application in NEMS/MEMS devices are also studied. Parametric studies are performed for sample cases to demonstrate application of the developed model. It is shown that aspect ratio and diameter of NWs are crucial controlling parameters for determining the performance of nanocomposite electrical generators. Numerical results disclose that there is an optimum aspect ratio for each NW of specific diameter. It was also shown that despite the symmetry of loading with respect to mid-plane normal to the NW's axis, the electric potential is not symmetric.(C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1263,"A simple and accurate scheme for modeling microstructures is proposed with the help of element trimming, combined with signed distance function based boundary smoothing. To accommodate randomly distributed fibers in unidirectional composites, digital image processing is used. The interfaces of multi materials are identified by introducing a signed distance function, and then, square background elements crossing the interfaces are simply trimmed and divided to represent a single material behavior by a single element. After element trimming, the elements that are polygon-shaped in the two-dimensional domain are split into conventional three-node triangle elements (six-node prism elements in the three-dimensional domain) available in many commercial software packages. The present modeling scheme was verified through benchmark examples in terms of the accuracy and efficiency and then applied to the modeling of unidirectional composites based on real microscopic images to evaluate the equivalent elastic properties.

1264,"Algorithms are hard to understand for novice computer science students because they dynamically modify values of elements of abstract data structures. Animations can help to understand algorithms, since they connect abstract concepts to real life objects and situations. In the past 30-35 years, there have been conducted many experiments in the field of usage of animations and visualizations in education, but they showed mixed results. In this paper, we review past research within the field and summarize recommendations regarding the graphic design and interactivity of the animations. In the second part of the paper, we present our interactive card sorting animations with conceptual views. The goal of these animations is to help students understand the main ideas and differences between basic sorting algorithms. In a pedagogical experiment related to these animations, 92 first-year computer science students of J. Selye University in Komarno (Slovakia) were asked to fill in a pre-test, experiment with the interactive animations, and fill in a post-test. The results showed that animations helped students to understand essential aspects of sorting algorithms. However, the participants were not able to understand the sorting algorithms in detail, so other types of animations are needed to teach algorithms in-depth.

1265,"A full software radio receiver is supposed to receive any signals in a wide band within a range from 0 to 5 GHz. But, linearity constraints are very strong because of all the non-idealities of such a complex system. Those non-idealities generate some undesired signals (interferers) leading to a degradation of reception. They can be counteracted by compensation. This paper proposes a mixed system of wide-band linearization consisting in an analog spectral sensor (SASP), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and an analog compensation signal generator. High-level simulation results in VHDL-AMS language exhibits a rejection of 60dB for continuous wave (CW) interferers.

1267,"A portable tester for accessing human skin status quantitatively at home is reported. An interdigital electrode (IDE) that contacts directly with human skin is used as the sensing element. The electrode-skin model is simplified as a resistance and a capacitance in series. Using square wave signal for excitation, impedance of the IDE is measured in a charging/discharging way. During one measurement cycle, the response voltages at two excitation frequencies, i.e., 10 kHz and 600 Hz, are measured successively. Equivalent resistance and capacitance of skin are then resolved from the measured values. Both the numerical and experimental simulation results indicate that the proposed circuit and corresponding algorithms work well for resistors and capacitors. The performance of the tester is experimentally tested with human skin in cases of different status. Obvious relationship between the measured values and the skin status is observed. Moreover, distinctive results are obtained between hydrating and emollient cosmetics smeared skins. The tester can be potentially used to give a quantitative guidance for individual skin care, such as cosmetics selection.

A survey was conducted in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia to collect the opinions of construction professionals regarding CSFs for construction project briefing. Through factor analysis, reliability, and validity analyses, the following seven CSFs were established: (1)client's business, organization, and project requirements; (2)requirements of stakeholders; (3)knowledge, experience, and cultural background of the stakeholders; (4)decision making and management skills of the senior project managers; (5)competence of the design team; (6)balanced interest of the stakeholders; and (7)the process of briefing. Although this research study involves a limited sample size, the survey findings and hands-on experience of the relevant industrial practitioners can be cross referenced to similar investigations in other parts of the world for international comparisons. The CSFs systematically identified and categorized enable practitioners in the construction industry to manage the briefing process successfully.

1271,"A discretization method is proposed for a rather general class of nonlinear continuous-time systems, which can have a piecewise-constant input, such as one under digital control via a zero-order-hold device. The resulting discrete-time model is expressed as a product of the integration-gain and the system function that governs the dynamics of the original continuous-time system. This is made possible with the use of the delta or Euler operator and makes comparisons of discrete and continuous time systems quite simple, since the difference between the two forms is concentrated into the integration-gain. This gain is determined in the paper by using the Riccati approximation of a certain gain condition that is imposed on the discretized system to be an exact model. The method is shown to produce a smaller error norm than one uses the linear approximation. Simulations are carried out for a Lotka-Volterra and an averaged van der Pol nonlinear systems to show the superior performance of the proposed model to ones known to be online computable, such as the forward-difference, Kahan's, and Mickens' methods. Insights obtained should be useful for developing digital control laws for nonlinear continuous-time systems, which is currently limited to the simplest forward-difference model.

Such is the case in the industrial sector where the automation process relieved partly or wholly the human activities needed in the manufacturing process.

In this context, our main contribution relates to a custom interrupt management scheduling policy implemented in hardware at the nHSE level, in order to provide predictable execution for asynchronous interrupts. By reducing the jitter when handling with asynchronous interrupts and completely eliminating the uncertainties of the scheduling limit for the set of tasks, a significant improvement of the overall system's predictability has been obtained.

However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities.

A large-scale retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing the clinical features and outcome of CD-associated SBA and de novo SBA. Method Data for patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma were gathered from the 1992-2010 United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry- Medicare linked database. We identified 2123 patients, of whom 179 had CD-associated and 1944 de novo SBA. The main outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Results CD-associated SBA was most commonly located in the ileum (62% vs 31%, P < 0.0001). CD patients were diagnosed at an earlier stage (I/II), compared with de novo SBA (55% vs 32%, P < 0.0001), and were more likely to undergo surgery (81% vs 72%, P = 0.0016). Chemotherapy use was similar (25% vs 21%, P = 0.1886). Patients with CD-associated SBA had better 5-year OS (43% vs 34%, P = 0.0121) but a similar CSS (65% vs 64%, P = 0.77). There was no difference in the OS between the cohorts when stratified by stage. On multivariate analysis, CD was not significantly related to OS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.20, P = 0.7889]. Surgery and the extent of lymphadenectomy improved OS for all SBA patients (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88, P = 0.001), whereas chemotherapy did not (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.99-1.28, P = 0.0665). Conclusion Patients with CD-associated SBA present at an earlier stage than patients with de novo SBA, they receive more surgery but similar rates of chemotherapy, and have similar OS and CSS. The presence of CD does not worsen survival after treatment of SBA.

1282,"Ailanthus altissima pollen (AAP) is considered as an emerging cause of respiratory allergy in United States, Italy and Iran. However, the allergenic composition of AAP is still unknown and has yet to be characterized. The present study aimed to identify AAP allergens using a proteomics-based approach. For this purpose, optimized AAP protein extracts were analyzed using 1D- and 2D- gel electrophoresis and confronted to twenty sera from individuals with respiratory allergy during the AAP season. Candidate allergens were detected using the serum from an allergic patient with clinical history of AAP pollinosis. IgE-binding spots were identified using MALDI-TOF/OF mass spectrometry and database searching. According to our results, AAP extracts were rich in proteins (up to 16.25 mg/ml) with a molecular-weight distribution ranging from 10 to 175 kDa. Two-D electrophoresis of AAP extracts revealed 125 protein spots from which 13 were IgE reactive. These IgE-binding proteins were identified as enolase, calreticulin, probable pectate lyase 6, conserved hypothetical protein and ras-related protein RHN1-like. By our knowledge, this study is the first report identifying AAP allergens. These findings will open up further avenues for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of the AAP allergy as well as for the cloning and molecular characterization of relevant allergens. Biological significance: Ailanthus altissima colonizes new areas every year in Iran and is spreading aggressively worldwide. According to USDA, the tree of heaven is now present as an invasive plant in 30 states in US (www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/treeheaven.shtml) and come to dominate large areas in many regions. Up to now, several cases of allergy to A. altissima pollen have been reported in United States, Italy and Iran [14]. However, there is still no information on the sensitizing allergens and the molecular origin of these clinical symptoms, which constitutes a serious threat to patients suffering from respiratory allergies in these regions. To our knowledge, the current study describes, therefore, the first panel of proteins responsible for IgE-mediated A. altissima pollinosis by using a gel-based proteomic approach.

This film can simultaneously harness the chemical potential of light and aerial humidity gradients to convert them into mechanical work. The strong reversible hygroscopicity of the agarose matrix induces swift locomotion by mechanical deformation owing to exchange of water with the surroundings. Driven by humidity, a 20mg composite film coupled to a piezoelectric bending transducer sensor generates a peak output of approximately 80mV, which corresponds to a power density of 25Wkg(-1). Excitation with UV light triggers isomerization of the chromophore, which appears as reshaping by spiraling, bending, or twisting of the film.

These expansions are typically made up of NKG2C(+) NK cells with particular killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) expression patterns. Such NK cell expansion patterns are also seen in patients with viral hepatitis infection. Yet, it is not known if the viral hepatitis infection promotes the appearance of such expansions or if effects are solely attributed to underlying CMV infection. In sizeable cohorts of CMV seropositive hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infected patients, we analyzed NK cells for expression of NKG2A, NKG2C, CD57, and inhibitory KIRs to assess the appearance of NK cell expansions characteristic of what has been seen in CMV seropositive healthy individuals. Adaptive like NK cell expansions observed in viral hepatitis patients were strongly associated with CMV seropositivity. The number of subjects with these expansions did not differ between CMV seropositive viral hepatitis patients and corresponding healthy controls. Hence, we conclude that adaptive-like NK cell expansions observed in HBV, HCV, and/or HDV infected individuals are not caused by the chronic hepatitis infections per se, but rather are a consequence of underlying CMV infection.

Given that the cerebral blood flow (CBF) or regulation of cerebral circulation is attenuated in the elderly, it could be expected that ageing-induced cognitive deterioration may be affected by a decrease in CBF as a result of brain ischemia and energy depletion. CBF regulation associated with cerebral metabolism thus likely plays an important role in the preservation of cognitive function. However, in some specific conditions (e.g. during exercise), change in CBF does not synchronize with that of cerebral metabolism. Our recent study demonstrated that cognitive function was more strongly affected by changes in cerebral metabolism than by changes in CBF during exercise. Therefore, it remains unclear how an alteration in CBF or its regulation affects cognitive function. In this review, I summarize current knowledge on previous investigations providing the possibility of an interaction between regulation of CBF or cerebral metabolism and cognitive function.

In this paper, we investigate fusion functions for attributes of which the values can be sorted by means of an order relation that reflects a notion of generality. It is shown that providing such an order relation a priori, let alone keeping it up-to-date, is a costly operation. Therefore, the Dynamical Order Construction (DOC) algorithm is proposed that constructs an order relation in an automated fashion upon inspecting the data that need to be fused. Such order relations can be immediately deployed in a framework of selectional fusion functions, which are fusion functions that adopt the sort-and-select principle.

In this context, the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and VM-placement poses new and different challenges not addressed yet in hybrid datacenter. In particular, we foresee two issues: (i) the number of edge-switches that can be simultaneously reached using optical paths from an edge-switch is limited by the size of the optical switch, (ii) the dynamic creation of optical paths can potentially establish a constrained optical network topology leading to poor performance.

1296,"A series of 2-arylethenyl-N-methylquinolinium derivatives were designed and synthesized based on our previous research of 2-arylethenylquinoline analogues as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2015, 89, 349e361). The results of in vitro biological activity evaluation, including beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregation inhibition, cholinesterase inhibition, and antioxidant activity, showed that introduction of N-methyl in quinoline ring significantly improved the anti-AD potential of compounds. The optimal compound, compound a12, dramatically attenuated the cell death of glutamate-induced HT22 cells by preventing the generation of ROS and increasing the level of GSH. Most importantly, intragastric administration of a12 circle HAc was well tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg and could traverse blood-brain barrier. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

1297,"Aim : Major depressive episode (MDE) can manifest with different features. Discriminating between different types of MDEs is crucial for proper treatment. The aim of this study is to propose a new tool for MDE assessment in bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) to overcome some limitations of current rating scales. The proposed tool investigates all of the clinical features of different MDEs and gives qualitative information, differentiating patients with the same score but different symptoms and psychopathology severity. To achieve this purpose authors used a new methodology called Formal Psychological Assessment (FPA). FPA allows creating relations between the items of an assessment tool, and the set of diagnostic criteria of a given clinical disorder. In the application at hand, given the capability to analyze all clinical features, FPA appears a useful way to highlight and differentiate between inhibited and agitated depressive symptoms. Method : The new tool contains 41 items constructed through 23 clinical criteria from the DSM-5 and literature symptoms. In line with FPA, starting from a set of items and a set of clinical criteria, a Boolean matrix was built assigning to each item its own set of clinical criteria. The participants include 265 in the control group and 38 patients with MDE (diagnosed with MDD or BD) who answered the QuEDS. After 1 month, 63 participants performed the test again and 113 took the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale to analyze convergent-divergent validity. Results : The scale showed adequate reliability and validity. A hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis highlighted the presence of three sub factors (affective, somatic, and cognitive) and one high-order factor (depression). Conclusions : The new tool is potentially able to inform clinicians about the patients' most likely diagnostic configuration. Indeed, the clinical state of a patient consists of the subset of items he/she answered affirmatively, along with his/her subset of specific symptoms. Qualitative information is fundamental from a clinical perspective, allowing for the analysis and treatment of each patient according to his/her symptoms in an effective way.

1298,"A novel approach using microresonating system with low power consumption is proposed for determining Young's modulus of mirco and nano-sized waveguide material. Based on the Mason rule with signal flow graph (SFG) method in the Z-domain, the optical transfer function is derived for resonating layout consists of two single microring resonators which are indirectly coupled to an add-drop micro resonator. A mathematical function is determined for critical coupling coefficient and the optimum optical transmission of proposed system. For the resonant mode numbers of 5;3;3, the free spectral range (FSR) is extended to 182 nm with the out of band rejection ratio(OBRR) of 50 dB and the Q factor is 8593. The Young's modulus is determined based on a change in the sensing ring radius due to the applied external force on the waveguide that causes the wavelength shift in resonant peaks. The Young's modulus for the lateral surface of the SOI waveguide with 250 nm height and 1.5 mu m radius is determined to be 147.72 GPa and for the upper surface of the SOI waveguide with 440 nm average width and 1.5 mu m radius is determined to be 83.93 GPa. The proposed resonating system is a potential candidate for measuring Young's modulus of materials in mirco and nano size with high resolution and has the advantages of the low power consumption due to the low intensity source.

The most common causes of acquired pendular nystagmus include demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and the syndrome of ocular palatal tremor. However, several other deficits, such as pharmacological intoxication, metabolic and genetic disorders, and granulomatous disorders can lead to syndromes mimicking acquired pendular nystagmus. Study of the kinematic features of acquired pendular nystagmus has suggested a putative pathophysiology of an otherwise mysterious neurological disorder. Here we review clinical features of neurological deficits that co-occur with acquired pendular nystagmus.

1301,"A spectrum of disease extends beyond the rigid confines of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) encompasses non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) in individuals without established radiographic changes but with other clinical/imaging axSpA features and AS in those with definite sacroiliac joint changes on pelvic X-rays. A broad consensus about the management of nr-axSpA is emerging among clinicians, but the evidence base remains open to question. To explore whether nr-axSpA and AS should be treated similarly, we examined the literature on their prevalence, natural history, disease burden, and treatment. There is strong evidence that nr-axSpA and AS are expressions of the same disease. Approximately 10% of patients with nr-axSpA will develop radiographic disease over 2 years; after >20 years, the figure may exceed 80%. Nr-axSpA patients have lower CRP and less spinal inflammation on MRI than AS patients but similar disease activity, pain, and quality-of-life impairment. Most patients with nr-axSpA manage well with conservative treatment, but a minority has severe disabling symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy has demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in nr-axSpA and AS. Current evidence does not clearly indicate that anti-TNF treatment can inhibit or limit bony progression of AS, the basis of conservative and anti-TNF treatment is control of symptoms and function. For some patients with nr-axSpA, the need for powerful treatments is as great as in some with AS; thus, treatment of axSpA should be consistent across the axSpA spectrum with anti-TNF agents being available, irrespective of radiographic change, according to the same criteria as those applied to AS.

1302,"A 2.5-year-old spayed female American Pit Bull Terrier dog presented with a primary complaint of chronic refractory ascites. The dog's CBC displayed a moderate to severe macrocytic, hypochromic, nonregenerative anemia, and a moderate leukopenia as result of a moderate neutropenia and monocytopenia. Microscopic examination of the blood smear showed marked anisocytosis, mild polychromasia, mild acanthocytosis and ovalocytosis, moderate schistocytosis and poikilocytosis, and 4 metarubricytes/100 WBC. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a homogenous, mild to moderately hyperechoic appearing liver as well as marked amounts of speckled anechoic to slightly hypoechoic peritoneal fluid. Cytology of the ascitic fluid demonstrated a sterile transudate, with evidence of a chronic inflammatory reaction as well as erythroid and myeloid precursor cells, and a few megakaryocytes with occasional micromegakaryocytes. Histologic sections of bone marrow, spleen, and liver were examined, using routine H&E stains, as well as a variety of immunohistochemistry and other special stains. Histopathology of the bone marrow and spleen revealed varying degrees of fibrosis, erythroid, and myeloid hyperplasia, as well as multiple small hyperplastic clusters of megakaryocytes. The megakaryocytes displayed many features of atypia such as increased cytoplasmic basophilia and occasional abnormal chromatin clumping with mitoses. Histopathologic examination of the liver disclosed evidence of mild extramedullary hematopoiesis. This case represents the first report of canine idiopathic myelofibrosis associated with peritoneal extramedullary hematopoiesis, resulting in refractory ascites. Although idiopathic myelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition in dogs, this case demonstrates that ascites caused by peritoneal implants of hematopoietic tissue may be the initial manifestation of myelofibrosis.

But being able to analyse the body of the user selecting only a subset of the same, has both advantages and disadvantages. Therefore throughout this article we will expose those disadvantages, the applied solution to mitigate them and the results of an evaluation destined to clear which body parts make it easier to obtain high accuracy rates in recognition.

Ruxolitinib was given twice a day (bid) at a starting dose of 15 mg (n = 25) or 20 mg (n = 38) based on a baseline platelet count. About 94.7% of the patients achieved a reduction in spleen size, 27.0% of which exhibited significant reduction (>= 35%) at week 24. Significant improvement in debilitating constitutional symptoms, as assessed by MFSAF v2.0, was observed in patients treated with ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib treatment was generally well tolerated by Chinese patients. Although the treatment was associated with an increase in certain adverse events (AEs) that were established as identified risks (anemia and thrombocytopenia), these AEs were considered manageable in this clinical setting.

1305,"A model of the dynamics of self-regulation describes two patterns of commitment or progress that individuals may follow when selecting goal directed behaviors. In the commitment pattern, individuals are more likely to highlight congruent goal behavior choices while in the progress pattern individuals are more likely to balance between incongruent and congruent goal behavior choices. This study set out to test the model in the context of problematic Internet usage. After being primed about problematic Internet usage, a sample of 97 undergraduate university students completed an online survey rating the value of Internet, academic and social-related behaviors across three conditions. The three conditions paired behaviors so that they appeared to complement each other, appeared to compete against each other, and presented them individually. Results showed that Internet behaviors were rated more highly when presented as complementary than when presented as competing, supporting the prediction that presentation format primes progress and commitment frameworks and leads to higher ratings of incongruent goal behavior in the progress condition. While results did not fully support the model's predictions regarding congruent goal behavior, they were in the predicted direction with small to moderate effect sizes. This study may inform clinical interventions by suggesting that individuals experiencing issues with problematic Internet usage would benefit from framing self-regulatory dilemmas in a competing format.

1306,"Accumulating research indicates that the regular practice of physical exercise is beneficial to the human brain. From the improvement of academic achievement in children to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly, exercise appears beneficial across the developmental spectrum. Recent work from animal studies also indicates that a pregnant mother can transfer the benefits of exercise during gestation to her offspring's brain. Exercising pregnant rats give birth to pups that have better memory and spatial learning as well as increased synaptic density. To investigate whether this transfer from the pregnant mother to her child also occurs in humans, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=18) and measured the impact of exercise during pregnancy on the neuroelectric response of the neonatal brain with electroencephalography (EEG). Here we show that, compared to the newborns of mothers who were inactive during their pregnancy, the children of exercising pregnant women are born with more mature brains. This was measured with the infant slow positive mismatch response (SPMMR), an electroencephalographic potential known to decrease in amplitude with age. The SPMMR reflects processes associated with brain maturation via its response to sound discrimination and auditory memory. In this study, the children of the mothers who exercised throughout their pregnancy have a smaller SPMMR than the children of mothers who remained sedentary (p=.019). Our results demonstrate the impact regular exercise during pregnancy can have on the development of the human fetal brain.

1308,"A real-time image filtering technique is proposed which could result in faster implementation for fingerprint image enhancement. One major hurdle associated with fingerprint filtering techniques is the expensive nature of their hardware implementations. To circumvent this, a modified anisotropic Gaussian filter is efficiently adopted in hardware by decomposing the filter into two orthogonal Gaussians and an oriented line Gaussian. An architecture is developed for dynamically controlling the orientation of the line Gaussian filter. To further improve the performance of the filter, the input image is homogenized by a local image normalization. In the proposed structure, for a middle-range reconfigurable FPGA, both parallel compute-intensive and real-time demands were achieved. We manage to efficiently speed up the image-processing time and improve the resource utilization of the FPGA. Test results show an improved speed for its hardware architecture while maintaining reasonable enhancement benchmarks.

In the proposed method artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to derive a simple formula to predict the natural frequencies of cable-stayed bridges based on existing natural frequency data. Unlike in the existing empirical methods, no functional relationship among the variables is assumed before we can develop an ANN model. ANN automatically constructs the relationships and adapts based on the training data presented to them. Also, the proposed method takes into account the wide range of parameters which may have a significant effect on the natural frequencies of cable-stayed bridges. The proposed method is particularly useful for the preliminary design stage of cable-stayed bridges where free vibration analysis needs to be carried out. The proposed method is compared with two existing empirical methods. It is found that the simplified method proposed in this study can produce a more accurate prediction of the natural frequencies of cable-stayed bridges than the existing empirical methods.

This modelling tool aims to contribute to urban water planning for smart city development. Plugrisost is a simulation model that facilitates the evaluation of rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater systems at different scales of urban planning, It is the only tool known thus far to integrate structural elements such as the sizing of storage tanks, estimated cost and quantitative environmental analysis. Plugrisost can be an adequate tool in the design stage because it provides environmental and economic information related to rainwater tank sizing and its estimates are more conservative than those of other tools. Plugrisost contributes to the design of urban infrastructure of low environmental impact, such as infrastructure that incorporates the use of rainwater, and the self-sufficiency analysis of water in cities. Using Plugrisost, we have found that on the singlehouse scale, the economic viability of an RWH system would be possible if the price of water is greater than 4 Euros/m(3); and the environmental analysis would be favourable to tanks with less than 5 m(3) of storage capacity. On the apartment-building scale, the results are 1.4 Euros/m(3) and 33 m(3), respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Deviations from these percentages and their impacts on operational capabilities are of particular interest to healthcare planners. In this study, we investigate intelligent ways of admitting patients to a proton therapy facility that maximize the total expected number of treatment sessions (fractions) delivered to patients in a planning period with stochastic patient arrivals and penalize the deviation from the patient mix restrictions. We propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that provides very useful insights in determining the best patient admission policies in the case of an unexpected opening in the facility (i.e., no-shows, appointment cancellations, etc.). In order to overcome the curse of dimensionality for larger and more realistic instances, we propose an aggregate MDP model that is able to approximate optimal patient admission policies using the worded weight aggregation technique. Our models are applicable to healthcare treatment facilities throughout the United States, but are motivated by collaboration with the University of Florida Proton Therapy Institute (UFPTI).

1314,"A novel type of hydraulic structure is proposed for rainwater harvesting in an arid area of Jordan. The project is to develop an irrigation scheme near the Dead Sea, where low annual precipitation and high salinity are the major concerns. The scheme consists of an irrigated farm, a reservoir, and an intake structure to divert ephemeral flood flows into the reservoir. The harvested water is expected to be fresh in comparison with the groundwater in the vulnerable freshwater lens. This research focusses on hydraulic design and actual construction processes of the structure. The structure consists of a gutter cutting across a 16 m wide valley bottom and a conveyance channel of 60 m long to guide the water into the reservoir. The conveyance channel is equipped with a spillway part. As a result of level surveys and hydrological considerations, it was revealed that the structure should have a width of 1.6 m and supercritical flows should be dominant. Details of structure dimensions were designed with numerical and model experiments. A finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional shallow water equations was used to numerically reproduce the whole flow field during a rainwater harvesting event with the maximum design discharge. The numerical scheme employs special fluxsplitting and data reconstruction techniques that realize stable computation of very shallow transcritical flows. A distorted hydraulic model with 1/8 horizontal scale and 1/1 roughness scale was constructed in an experimental station in Japan, in order to test hydraulic phenomena that the numerical method cannot represent. Then, the structure was actually constructed at the site. The channel bottoms are made of reinforced concrete, while the side walls are of concrete blocks whose sizes have been chosen according to the design. However, minor changes were made during the construction processes due to workability constraints. The numerical experiments were conducted again to confirm the actual structure showing desired performance.

To gain novel insights into its genetic complexity, we chosen six A, caldus strains for comparative survey. All strains analyzed in this study differ in geographic origins as well as in ecological preferences. Based on phylogenomic analysis, we clustered the six A, caldus strains isolated from various ecological niches into two groups: group 1 strains with smaller genomes and group 2 strains with larger genomes. We found no obvious intraspecific divergence with respect to predicted genes that are related to central metabolism and stress management strategies between these two groups. Although numerous highly homogeneous genes were observed, high genetic diversity was also detected. Preliminary inspection provided a first glimpse of the potential correlation between intraspecific diversity at the genome level and environmental variation, especially geochemical conditions. Evolutionary genetic analyses further showed evidence that the difference in environmental conditions might be a crucial factor to drive the divergent evolution of A, caldus species. We identified a diverse pool of mobile genetic elements including insertion sequences and genomic islands, which suggests a high frequency of genetic exchange in these harsh habitats. Comprehensive analysis revealed that gene gains and losses were both dominant evolutionary forces that directed the genomic diversification of A, caldus species. For instance, horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events in group 2 strains might contribute to an increase in microbial DNA content and novel functions. Moreover, genomes undergo extensive changes in group 1 strains such as removal of potential non-functional DNA, which results in the formation of compact and streamlined genomes. Taken together, the findings presented herein show highly frequent gene turnover of A. caldus species that inhabit extremely acidic environments, and shed new light on the contribution of gene turnover to the evolutionary adaptation of acidophiles.

1318,"An improved continuum model of three-span suspension bridges has been developed to study the effects of hanger extensibility on free vertical vibrations. This model can be applied to both hinged and continuous girders. To obtain the equations of motion, coupled differential equations describing the vertical deflections of the main cable and the girder are derived with dimensionless parameters. Following the Galerkin method, with shape functions for the main cable and for hinged and continuous girders, equations of motion are obtained in matrix form. A compatibility equation is used to eliminate the additional horizontal force of the main cable in the equations. Natural frequencies of hinged and continuous suspension bridges are evaluated as a function of six dimensionless parameters: the relative elastic bending stiffness of the girder, the relative elastic axial stiffness of the main cable, the relative elastic axial stiffness of the hangers, the relative mass of the girder, the relative length of the side span, and the ratio of the main span sag to the maximum hanger length. Parametric studies are conducted in which each of these parameters is varied individually to observe its effect on the natural frequencies and to identify differences between a conventional model with inextensible hangers and the improved model with extensible hangers. It is found that hanger extensibility affects the natural frequencies and mode shapes of higher modes for suspension bridges with a large relative girder stiffness. This effect is slightly more pronounced for antisymmetric modes and continuous bridges. In addition, even for a bridge with a large relative girder stiffness, the hanger extensibility rarely affects the natural frequencies of higher modes if the bridge either has a large relative mass of the girder or a large relative length of the side span.

This review focuses on the cytokine receptor that plays a significant role in thrombopoiesis: the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO-R; also known as MPL). Here, we survey the work to date to understand how this receptor functions at a molecular level throughout its lifecycle, from traffic to the cell surface, dimerization and binding cognate cytokine via its extracellular domain, through to its subsequent activation of associated Janus kinases and initiation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as the regulation of these processes. Atomic level resolution structures of TPO-R have remained elusive. The identification of disease-causing mutations in the receptor has, however, offered some insight into structure and function relationships, as has artificial means of receptor activation, through TPO mimetics, transmembrane-targeting receptor agonists, and engineering in dimerization domains. More recently, a novel activation mechanism was identified whereby mutated forms of calreticulin form complexes with TPO-R via its extracellular N-glycosylated domain. Such complexes traffic pathologically in the cell and persistently activate JAK2, downstream signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), and other pathways. This pathologic TPO-R activation is associated with a large fraction of human myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Spike sorting includes a novel approach to constructing a dictionary learning algorithm in a Compressed Sensing (CS) framework. We present a joint prediction scheme to determine the class of neural spikes in the dictionary learning framework; and, the second approach is a modified OSort algorithm which is implemented in a distributed system optimized for power efficiency. Furthermore, sorted spikes and time-frequency analysis of LFP signals can be used to generate derived features (including cross-frequency coupling, spike-field coupling). We then show how these derived features can be used in the design and development of novel decode and closed-loop control algorithms that are optimized to apply deep brain stimulation based on a patient's neuropsychiatric state. For the control algorithm, we define the state vector as representative of a patient's impulsivity, avoidance, inhibition, etc. Controller parameters are optimized to apply stimulation based on the state vector's current state as well as its historical values. The overall algorithm and software design for our implantable neural recording and stimulation system uses an innovative, adaptable, and reprogrammable architecture that enables advancement of the state-of-the-art in closed-loop neural control while also meeting the challenges of system power constraints and concurrent development with ongoing scientific research designed to define brain network connectivity and neural network dynamics that vary at the individual patient level and vary over time.

1326,"A previous bioinformatics analysis identified the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins Rv2125 and Rv2714 as orthologs of the eukaryotic proteasome assembly chaperone 2 (PAC2). We set out to investigate whether Rv2125 or Rv2714 can function in proteasome assembly. We solved the crystal structure of Rv2125 at a resolution of 3.0 angstrom, which showed an overall fold similar to that of the PAC2 family proteins that include the archaeal PbaB and the yeast Pba1. However, Rv2125 and Rv2714 formed trimers, whereas PbaB forms tetramers and Pba1 dimerizes with Pba2. We also found that purified Rv2125 and Rv2714 could not bind to M. tuberculosis 20S core particles. Finally, proteomic analysis showed that the levels of known proteasome components and substrate proteins were not affected by disruption of Rv2125 in M. tuberculosis. Our work suggests that Rv2125 does not participate in bacterial proteasome assembly or function. IMPORTANCE Although many bacteria do not encode proteasomes, M. tuberculosis not only uses proteasomes but also has evolved a posttranslational modification system called pupylation to deliver proteins to the proteasome. Proteasomes are essential for M. tuberculosis to cause lethal infections in animals; thus, determining how proteasomes are assembled may help identify new ways to combat tuberculosis. We solved the structure of a predicted proteasome assembly factor, Rv2125, and isolated a genetic Rv2125 mutant of M. tuberculosis. Our structural, biochemical, and genetic studies indicate that Rv2125 and Rv2714 do not function as proteasome assembly chaperones and are unlikely to have roles in proteasome biology in mycobacteria.

Aiming at the deficiency of traditional PR controller, this paper puts forward an improved PR controller-vector resonant controller. The controller has the advantages of stronger anti-interference ability and greater gain at the resonance point, and it can improve the accuracy of harmonic compensation in the current compensation control. In this paper, the digital controller in the digital control system has been given a detailed design. Finally, the experimental results show that the control strategy can further reduce the harmonic content and improve the compensation accuracy.

Diagnosis requires both the presence of clinical symptoms and low testosterone levels. However, diagnosing andropause in this age group may be challenging since symptoms are frequently non specific and testosterone levels are influenced by a multitude of parameters such as lifestyle factors and chronic diseases. In this article we discuss the pathophysiology, definition and diagnostic difficulties of andropause in geriatric patients. Moreover, we review the relation between testosterone levels and frequent geriatric syndromes such as falls, osteoporosis, cognitive and mood disorders, anemia and cardiovascular disease. Finally, we examine the potential benefits and risks of testosterone replacement therapy in this age group. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, such a closed system approach often leaves little room for injecting domain expertise and can result in frustration from analysts when results seem spurious or confusing. In order to allow for more human-centric approaches, the visualization community has begun developing methods to enable users to incorporate expert knowledge into the prediction process at all stages, including data cleaning, feature selection, model building and model validation. This paper surveys current progress and trends in predictive visual analytics, identifies the common framework in which predictive visual analytics systems operate, and develops a summarization of the predictive analytics workflow.

1330,"Adolescence is a key developmental period for preventing substance use initiation, however prevention programs solely providing educational information about the dangers of substance use rarely change adolescent substance use behaviors. Recent research suggests that mind-body practices such as yoga may have beneficial effects on several substance use risk factors, and that these practices may serve as promising interventions for preventing adolescent substance use. The primary aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of yoga for reducing substance use risk factors during early adolescence. Seventh-grade students in a public school were randomly assigned by classroom to receive either a 32-session yoga intervention (n = 117) in place of their regular physical education classes or to continue with physical-education-as-usual (n = 94). Participants (63.2 % female; 53.6 % White) completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessing emotional self-regulation, perceived stress, mood impairment, impulsivity, substance use willingness, and actual substance use. Participants also completed questionnaires at 6-months and 1-year post-intervention. Results revealed that participants in the control condition were significantly more willing to try smoking cigarettes immediately post-intervention than participants in the yoga condition. Immediate pre- to post-intervention differences did not emerge for the remaining outcomes. However, long-term follow-up analyses revealed a pattern of delayed effects in which females in the yoga condition, and males in the control condition, demonstrated improvements in emotional self-control. The findings suggest that school-based yoga may have beneficial effects with regard to preventing males' and females' willingness to smoke cigarettes, as well as improving emotional self-control in females. However additional research is required, particularly with regard to the potential long-term effects of mind-body interventions in school settings. The present study contributes to the literature on adolescence by examining school-based yoga as a novel prevention program for substance use risk factors.

1331,"An anomalously slight glacier mass gain during 2000 to the 2010s has recently been reported in the Karakoram region. However, to date, no investigations of the region-wide glacier mass balance in the Karakoram prior to 2000 have been reported, leaving a knowledge gap for assessing glacier responses to climate change. We calculated elevation and mass change using DEMs generated from KH-9 images acquired during 1973-1980 and the 1 arc-second SRTM DEM. We find a slight mass loss of -0.09 +/- 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) (12 366 km(2)) for 1973-2000, which is less negative than the global average rate for 19712009 (-0.31 +/- 0.19 m w.e. a(-1)). Within the Karakoram, the glacier change patterns are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. In particular, a nearly stable state in the central Karakoram (-0.04 +/- 0.05 m w.e. a(-1) during the period 1974-2000) implies that the Karakoram anomaly dates back to the 1970s. Combined with the previous studies, we conclude that the Karakoram glaciers as a whole were in a nearly balanced state during the 1970s to the 2010s.

1332,"A trophic ulcer is a pressure ulcer caused by external trauma to a part of the body that is compromised due to disease, vascular insufficiency, or loss of afferent nerve fibers. Spinal dysraphism (ie, neural tube defects [NTD]) such as meningomyelocele is a risk factor for developing these ulcers in adults and pediatric patients. Information regarding the occurrence of trophic ulcers in pediatric patients with NTD is lacking. A review of the English-language literature on skin/neuropathic ulcers in patients with NTDs, irrespective of study design, published between 1975 and 2014, was undertaken using the PubMed database. Search terms included trophic ulcer, neuropathic ulcer, NTDs, and meningomyelocele. From among the more than 200 papers related to skin care in neonates and pediatric patients, 11 addressed skin ulcers in patients of NTD - 1 in French (a review article), 1 in German (a case report), and 9 in English (7 cohort studies and 2 reviewing surgical techniques). Typically, ulcers in patients with NTD are neuropathic (ie, related to nerve pathology). The most common type is meningomyelocele. Patients with NTD present with a spectrum of functional and sensory deficits that impair mobility; other causative factors that may contribute to the occurrence of ulcers include stress to the tissue, the length of time the stress occurs, muscle spasticity, infection, moisture, and nutritional status of the patient. Awareness of ulcer risk and preventive measures, such as maintaining foot flexibility or careful handling bony prominences such as kyphosis, is important. Once an ulcer occurs, management is challenging and involves collaboration of multiple medical, surgical, nutrition, and other specialists. If an ulcer develops and NTD has not been previously treated surgically or the MRI shows evidence of retethering, surgical treatment is needed. More research is needed to help guide ulcer prevention and treatment strategies in pediatric patients with NTD.

However, it is still challenging due to its ill-posedness and complex non-rigid shape variations of a human body. In this paper, we use the Procrustean normal distribution mixture model as a 3D shape prior and propose a model transformation method for adjusting limb lengths of the 3D shape prior model, by which the proposed method can be applied to a novel test image. Inaccuracies of 2D part detections are handled by selecting from a diverse set of 2D pose candidates considering both the 2D part model and 3D shape model. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably compared with existing methods, despite inaccuracies of 2D part detections and 3D shape ambiguities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

1334,"Adsorption cooling and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems are promising technologies that can be used to exploit the abundant amount of low grade heat sources such as solar energy, geothermal energy and waste heat from industrial processes. In this study, a two bed adsorption cooling cycle has been integrated with an ORC to simultaneously generate cooling and power utilising AQSOA-ZO2 (SAPO-34)/water and silica-gel/water as adsorption working pairs and R245fa, R365mfc and R141b as ORC working fluids. Four different scenarios of integrated adsorption-ORC system have been investigated, where in the first three scenarios, adsorption system is set up as a topping system, while ORC is set up as a bottoming system. The first one utilized the waste heat of adsorption to power the ORC system with no additional heat and named as Adsorption Heat Recovery Scenario (AHRS). In the second scenario the adsorption return heating fluid is used to power the ORC system (Return Adsorption Heating Fluid Scenario RAHFS). In the third scenario (Heat Exchanger Scenario HES), the cooling and heating sources leaving the adsorption system enter a heat exchanger, where additional heat can be added to the cooling fluid in order to power the ORC system. In the fourth scenario (Return ORC Heating Fluid Scenario RORCHFS), the ORC is considered to be as a topping system, while the adsorption system considered as bottoming system and the return ORC heating fluid can be used to power the adsorption cycle. Results show that when using AHRS, the integrated adsorption-ORC system can achieved system efficiency of 70% using silica-gel/water and R141b and 60% using SAPO-34/water and R141b. In addition, the maximum Specific Power (SP) and Specific Cooling Power (SCP) can be achieved utilising SAPO-34 and R141b with values of 208 W/kg(ads) and 616 W/kg(ads) respectively.

1336,"Alternative materials, like recycling materials, industrial by-products and soils already influenced by human activities (e.g. urban soils) are commonly accepted as building material in earthwork constructions. The risk of contaminant leaching from these materials can be limited by reducing the amount of percolating water. Technical safeguards are means to achieve this, but they must be adapted to the requirements of road construction. The research project aims to better knowledge of the percolation and leaching processes in road embankments constructed from alternative materials with different technical safeguards. The input and behavior of water and contaminants from re-used soils and road runoff is measured in eight field lysimeters at an urban road in an enterprise zone in Augsburg, southern Germany with about 9,700 vehicles per day. Each lysimeter contains the cut out of an embankment. The technical safeguards aim to decrease percolation and include a capillary barrier/drainage layer from geotextile and a second one from gravel, a bituminous film of 1 kg/m(2) and a modified mineral sealing of 10 cm. A sandy gravel and a loamy soil were each used for construction of the embankment cut out in four lysimeters. The soils were spiked with a low contamination of Cd, Cu and CN- to test the efficiency of the technical safeguards. In the percolate water of the lysimeters as well as in the road runoff the pH value, electrical conductivity and the concentrations of sulphate, chloride, As, Pb, CN-, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Mo, Sb, Tl, V and Zn have been analyzed in two-week composite samples since July of 2010. The amount of road runoff, lysimeter runoff and percolating water with its electrical conductivity are measured continuously. It has to be noted that measures were taken during a testing period in order to solve imperfections in the test set-up. These measures will have affected the observations presented. Results show that the unfiltered road runoff shows considerable concentrations of Zn and also elevated concentrations of Pb, as expected from former experience and literature. Up to now, all embankment types lead to a strong retention of these two substances. However, elevated Zn and Pb concentrations can be found in the percolating water during times of high chloride concentrations originating from deicing salt. Furthermore it was shown that the average contaminant leaching of each lysimeter was relatively small during the measurement period. Changes in concentrations of other parameters seem to be induced mainly by high chloride content of the infiltrating road runoff, but the time of occurrence of the changes in the effluent as well as the temporal variations depend also on the soil type, soil pH and the technical safeguards. Additionally, it seems that the soil type has a stronger influence on the percolation process compared to the different technical safeguards. Possible reasons will be discussed.

1337,"A computational method to determine the shielding effectiveness against electromagnetic interference of carbon nanotube (CNTs)-based nanocomposites through modelling of its electrical properties is presented. Specifically, simulations based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) were implemented to evaluate the electrical conductivity (sigma) of CNTs (used as a filler in a polymer matrix) that formed electrical network inside a representative cuboid volume of the sample. A pseudo three-dimensional (3D) percolation model was developed to study the effects of random connectivity of CNTs to one another on the conductivity of nanocomposites. In our approach, both contact and intrinsic resistances were taken into account. The tunneling resistance between CNTs was also taken into account while dealing with single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). A resistor network recognition method that optimizes connective paths was built using ACO method and conductivity was subsequently computed as a function of CNTs concentration. Then, the shielding effectiveness was computed using the conductivity data. It is remarkable that the calculated SE values as a function of frequency of EM waves at a constant weight percent of CNTs were in agreement with the experimental data for CNT-based nanocomposites reported in literature.

Quantitative CBCT indices can be used to screen for women with low BMD. Purpose Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by the deterioration of bone tissue and the consequent decrease in BMD and increase in bone fragility. Several studies have been performed to assess radiometric indices in panoramic images as low-BMD predictors. The aim of this study is to correlate radiometric indices from CBCT images and BMD in postmenopausal women. Methods Sixty postmenopausal women with indications for dental implants and CBCT evaluation were selected. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed, and the patients were divided into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Cross-sectional images were used to evaluate the computed tomography mandibular index (CTMI), the computed tomography index (inferior) (CTI (I)) and computed tomography index (superior) (CTI (S)). Student's t test was used to compare the differences between the indices of the groups' intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Statistical analysis showed a high degree of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for all measurements (ICC >0.80). The mean values of CTMI, CTI (S), and CTI (I) were lower in the osteoporosis group than in osteopenia and normal patients (p < 0.05). In comparing normal patients and women with osteopenia, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean value of CTI (I) (p = 0.075). Conclusions Quantitative CBCT indices may help dentists to screen for women with low spinal and femoral bone mineral density so that they can refer postmenopausal women for bone densitometry.

The distributions of fluid temperature, fluid velocity and reinforcement particles in the molten pool are simulated using a 2D multi-physics model coupled with the equations of heat transfer, fluid dynamics, drag force, Lorentz force and phase transition. The results show that, the directional Lorentz force due to an electric-magnetic compound field, as a sort of volume force, can change the equivalent buoyancy acting on the particles. When the Lorentz force and gravity force are in same direction, majority of particles are trapped in the upper region of laser melt injection layer, while when the Lorentz force and gravity force are in opposite direction, most particles are concentrated in the bottom region. As a result, the distribution gradient of WC particles can be controlled by the electric-magnetic compound field, instead of the time-consuming adjustment of process parameters.

So, nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) plays an important role in the treatment of AD. However, current PPAR gamma-targeting drugs such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are associated with undesirable side effects. We identified herbal extract with a small molecular, astragaloside IV (AS-IV), as a selective PPAR gamma natural agonist in nervous cells by developing a PPAR-PPRE pathway regulatory system. Cultured SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-BACE1 were treated with AS-IV for 24 h or AS-IV plus the PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662 in vitro. APP/PS1 mice were intragastrically treated with AS-IV or AS-IV plus the GW9662 every 48 h for 3 months. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and real-time PCR were used to examine the expression of PPAR gamma and BACE1. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to analyze the distribution of A beta plaques in the APP/PS1 mouse brain. The levels of A beta were determined using ELISA kits. AS-IV was shown to be a PPAR gamma agonist by establishing a high-throughput screening model for PPAR gamma agonists. The results showed that AS-IV treatment increased activity of PPAR gamma and inhibited BACE1 in vitro. As a result, A beta levels decreased significantly. GW9662, which is a PPAR gamma antagonist, significantly blocked the beneficial role of AS-IV. In vivo, AS-IV treatment increased PPAR gamma and BACE1 expression and reduced neuritic plaque formation and A beta levels in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. These effects of AS-IV could be effectively inhibited by GW9662. These results indicate that AS-IV may be a natural PPAR gamma agonist that suppressed activity of BACE1 and ultimately attenuates generation of A beta. Therefore, AS-IV may be a promising agent for modulating A beta-related pathology in AD.

Method Fifty-four consecutive patients who underwent resection between 2011 and 2014 for ileocolic Crohn's disease were prospectively studied. All had preoperative MR or CT enterography. Two independent radiologists measured the length of the diseased intestinal segment. The measurements were compared with the length of disease assessed on pathology of the non-fixed surgical specimen. Results The median preoperative length of the Crohn's disease segment on imaging was 20.5 (2-73) cm and 20 (3-90) cm, as measured by the two radiologists. Interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.69) with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.82 (P < 0.001). The median length of the Crohn's disease segment on pathological examination was 16.5 (2-75) cm and was closely correlated with the radiological measurement (r = 0.76, P < 0.001). The length of the Crohn's disease segment on imaging was correct to within 5 cm of the value on pathology. It was correct in 30 (55%) patients and was underestimated and overestimated in 6 (11.1%) and 18 (33.3%). A length of disease of less than 20 cm found on imaging in 26 patients was confirmed in 25 (96%) on pathology, whereas a length of more than 20 cm found on imaging in 28 patients was confirmed in 18 (64%) on pathology. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and overall accuracy of imaging for predicting a length of less than 20 cm were 71%, 95%, 96%, 64% and 79%. Conclusion Imaging accurately identifies the length of the ileocolic segment of Crohn's disease when it is 20 cm or less on pathological examination. In patients with more extensive disease, imaging tends to overestimate the length and should be interpreted with caution.

One such means of achieving this is through the counselor attending to and expressing their ""presence,"" in which they are engaged in a ""person-to-person"" therapeutic alliance underpinned by a collaborative dynamic. Here, the healthy interpersonal dyad between client and counselor can provide an environment through which the client may more fully recognize their autonomous resources and exercise such resources in a way that enables them to embark on the rehabilitative journey, and, attendant to this, autonomous living.

1354,"A large set of earthquake records from the highly instrumented Samoa Channel bridge-ground system has been compiled and made available by the California Geological Survey. During six seismic events, more than 30 data channels have been documenting the seismic response of the bridge, abutments, and adjacent ground surface. Of special interest is the response of one of the bridge piers with records at the deck level, pile cap and within the underlying pile foundation. Response of this pile foundation is compared to that of the ground as documented by the nearby Eureka geotechnical downhole array. In this paper, records from the strongest to date 2010 Ferndale earthquake (PGA of about 0.16 g), along with other available low-amplitude events (2007-2014) are employed to evaluate the ground, pile foundation, and overall bridge seismic response. Spatial variation of the recorded motions is examined. Linear and nonlinear response of the ground and the bridge are assessed using system identification techniques. During the strong shaking phase of the 2010 Ferndale Earthquake, a clear and significant stiffness reduction was observed in the column as well as in the foundation of the instrumented pier.

1356,"A fast three-dimensional discrete cosine transform algorithm (3D FCT) and a fast 3D inverse cosine transform (3D IFCT) algorithm are presented, suitable for analysis of 3D data points. Many existing algorithms for three-dimensional data points make use of either the 1D cosine transform or both the 2D and 1D cosine transforms. Existing algorithms based on the 1D discrete cosine transform (DCT) apply the separable 1D transform to the data points in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, while those based on 2D and 1D transforms apply the 2D cosine transform for the x-y planes and then the 1D cosine transform in the z direction. The proposed 3D DCT algorithms handle the 3D data points directly and have been shown to be computationally efficient. They involve a 3D decomposition process where a data volume is recursively decomposed in each dimension until unit data cubes are obtained. The algorithms are presented in the form of a signal flow graph which captures the various computations involved. A complexity analysis along with empirical results is included, demonstrating the performance of the proposed direct 3D DCT algorithms. As 3D FCT and IFCT are symmetric and relatively fast, they can be used in any application requiring a real-time symmetric codec, such as video conferencing, online multiparty video games, and three-dimensional graphics rendering.

1357,"According to the Schema Therapy Model, maladaptive parenting styles interact with a child's unique temperament in the development of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs), which in turn increase one's risk for developing pathology. However, few authors have examined the comprehensive model. The purpose of this study was to assess the indirect effect of perceived parenting styles on depressive symptoms through EMSs. Furthermore, a series of moderated mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether the indirect effect varies as a function of temperament. A total of 403 undergraduate students completed measures of perceived parenting experiences, temperament, EMSs, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the schema domains of disconnection/rejection and impaired autonomy mediated the relationship between perceived parenting styles and depressive symptoms. Moderation of the indirect effect was only found in two of the twelve tested models. This study lends partial support to the Schema Therapy model and also offers a new way of looking at the interactive nature of the constructs.

1358,"Arid and semi-arid regions around the world face water scarcity problems due to lack of precipitation and unpredictable rainfall patterns. For thousands of years, rainwater harvesting (RWH) techniques have been applied to cope with water scarcity. Researchers have used many different methodologies for determining suitable sites and techniques for RWH. However, limited attention has been given to the evaluation of RWH structure performance. The aim of this research was to design a scientifically-based, generally applicable methodology to better evaluate the performance of existing RWH techniques in (semi-) arid regions. The methodology integrates engineering, biophysical and socio-economic criteria using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) supported by the Geographic Information System (GIS). Jessour/Tabias are the most traditional RWH techniques in the Oum Zessar watershed in south-eastern Tunisia, which were used to test this evaluation tool. Fifty-eight RWH locations (14 jessr and 44 tabia) in three main sub-catchments of the watershed were assessed and evaluated. Based on the criteria selected, more than 95% of the assessed sites received low or moderate suitability scores, with only two sites receiving high suitability scores. This integrated methodology, which is highly flexible, saves time and costs, is easy to adapt to different regions and can support designers and decision makers aiming to improve the performance of existing and new RWH sites.

1359,"A potential problem for persisting large volume of streaming logs with conventional relational databases is that loading large volume of data logs produced at high rates is not fast enough due to the strong consistency model and high cost of indexing. As a possible alternative, state-of-the-art NoSQL data stores that sacrifice transactional consistency to achieve higher performance and scalability can be utilized. In this paper, we describe the challenges in large scale persisting and analysis of numerical streaming logs. We propose to develop a benchmark comparing relational databases with state-of-the-art NoSQL data stores to persist and analyze numerical logs. The benchmark will investigate to what degree a state-of-the-art NoSQL data store can achieve high performance persisting and large-scale analysis of data logs. The benchmark will serve as basis for investigating query processing and indexing of large-scale numerical logs.

1361,"A simplified method for in-plane buckling analysis of pylons of multi-span suspension bridges was proposed. The analysis model is a pylon with an equivalent spring connected to it at the saddle. The stiffness of the equivalent spring was derived from the relation of the horizontal displacement at the saddle and restoring forces from the cables and was expressed with a simple formula. The stiffness of the deck is considered also in the simplified method. This method is suitable not only for three-pylon suspension bridges but also for the suspension bridge with multiple pylons. The example of the Taizhou Bridge with two span length of 2x1080m and three pylons indicates that the equivalent spring stiffness under different load case is not significant for a large span suspension bridge and the equivalent spring stiffness of mid-pylon is very small comparing with the side pylons, and the buckling problem of mid-pylons will be more important than side pylons for a continuous suspension bridge with multiple pylons.

1362,"Acute stress impairs the hippocampusdependent spatial memory retrieval, and its synaptic mechanisms are associated with hippocampal CA1 long-term depression (LTD) enhancement in the adult rats. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as a novel gasotransmitter and has the neural protective roles. However, very little attention has been paid to understanding the effects of H2S on spatial memory retrieval impairment. We observed the protective effects of NaHS (a donor of H2S) against spatial memory retrieval impairment caused by acute stress and its synaptic mechanisms. Our results showed that NaHS abolished spatial memory retrieval impairment and hippocampal CA1 LTD enhancement caused by acute stress, but not by glutamate transporter inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic (tPDC), indicating that the activation of glutamate transporters is necessary for exogenous H2S to exert its roles. Moreover, NaHS restored the decreased glutamate uptake in the hippocampal CA1 synaptosomal fraction caused by acute stress. Dithiothreitol (DTT, a disulfide reducing agent) abolished a decrease in the glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, and NaHS eradicated the decreased glutamate uptake caused by 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic)acid (DTNB, a thiol oxidizing agent), collectively, revealing that exogenous H2S increases glutamate uptake by reducing disulfide bonds of the glutamate transporters. Additionally, NaHS inhibited the increased expression level of phosphorylated c -Jun -N terminal kinase (JNK) in the hippocampal CA1 region caused by acute stress. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 eliminated spatial memory retrieval impairment, hippocampal CA1 LTD enhancement and the decreased glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, indicating that exogenous H2S exerts these roles by inhibiting the activation of JNK signaling pathway.

1367,"An organic p-n bilayer, comprising of an n-type perylene derivative (PTCBI) and p-type lead phthalocyanine (PbPc), was prepared and examined in terms of photoelectrode in the water phase. The PTCBI/PbPc bilayer functioned as a photoanode, which generated a photocurrent due to the oxidation of reactant (i.e., Fell(CN)(6)(4-)) at the PbPc surface. Furthermore, the organo-bilayer also induced a photocatalytic reaction that originated from the oxidising and reducing powers produced at the PbPc and PTCBI, respectively. Based on the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic studies, it has been noted that the PTCBI/PbPc bilayer can respond to the wide spectrum of solar energy (i.e., 400-1100 nm). However, on using metal free phthalocyanine (H2Pc, p-type) as a reference p-type layer and its application as a photocatalyst material in combination with PTCBI, the generated PTCBI/H2Pc bilayer did not show any photocatalysis particularly under the control irradiation of 700-1200 nm.

The reliance on ontologies will provide flexibility in the process and workproducts use within the methodology. The focus on domain knowledge will reduce the number of mandatory methodological tasks and at the same time create scope for reuse with respect to both system designs and components.

1373,"A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to meet at the same node. Agents are anonymous (identical), execute the same deterministic algorithm and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. An initial configuration of agents is called gatherable if there exists a deterministic algorithm (even dedicated to this particular configuration) that achieves meeting of all agents in one node. Which configurations are gatherable and how to gather all of them deterministically by the same algorithm? We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks. We characterize all gatherable configurations and give two universal deterministic gathering algorithms, i.e., algorithms that gather all gatherable configurations. The first algorithm works under the assumption that a common upper bound on the size of the network is known to all agents. In this case our algorithm guarantees gathering with detection, i.e., the existence of a round for any gatherable configuration, such that all agents are at the same node and all declare that gathering is accomplished. If no upper bound on the size of the network is known, we show that a universal algorithm for gathering with detection does not exist. Hence, for this harder scenario, we construct a second universal gathering algorithm, which guarantees that, for any gatherable configuration, all agents eventually get to one node and stop, although they cannot tell if gathering is over. The time of the first algorithm is polynomial in the upper bound on the size of the network, and the time of the second algorithm is polynomial in the (unknown) size itself. Our results have an important consequence for the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs. Leader election is a fundamental symmetry breaking problem in distributed computing. Its goal is to assign, in some common round, value 1 (leader) to one of the entities and value 0 (non-leader) to all others. For anonymous agents in graphs, leader election turns out to be equivalent to gathering with detection. Hence, as a by-product, we obtain a complete solution of the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs.

Acquired US data were analyzed through an automatic algorithm that calculated the Fragility Score (F.

F.S. showed a good correlation with the most reliable fracture risk predictions obtained by FRAX (R) (r=0.71, p<0.001). Since this correlation level with FRAX (R) outcomes was much better than lumbar BMD one ( vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.43) and very similar to that obtained for femoral neck BMD (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.72), F.S. has the potential to become a simple and non-ionizing method for bone fragility assessment.

1377,"Accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (A beta) in the brain represent an early and perhaps necessary step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A beta accumulation leads to the formation of A beta aggregates, which may directly and indirectly lead to eventual neurodegeneration. While A beta production is accelerated in many familial forms of early-onset AD, increasing evidence indicates that impaired clearance of A beta is more evident in late-onset AD. To uncover the mechanisms underlying impaired A beta clearance in AD, we examined the role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in astrocytes. Although LRP1 has been shown to play critical roles in brain A beta metabolism in neurons and vascular mural cells, its role in astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain responsible for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, remains unclear. Here, we show that astrocytic LRP1 plays a critical role in brain A beta clearance. LRP1 knockdown in primary astrocytes resulted in decreased cellular A beta uptake and degradation. In addition, silencing of LRP1 in astrocytes led to downregulation of several major A beta-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteases MMP2, MMP9, and insulin-degrading enzyme. More important, conditional knock-out of the Lrp1 gene in astrocytes in the background of APP/PS1 mice impaired brain A beta clearance, exacerbated A beta accumulation, and accelerated amyloid plaque deposition without affecting its production. Together, our results demonstrate that astrocytic LRP1 plays an important role in A beta metabolism and that restoring LRP1 expression and function in the brain could be an effective strategy to facilitate A beta clearance and counter amyloid pathology in AD.

1381,"A variety of compartment models are used for the quantitative analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data. Traditionally, these models use an iterative fitting (IF) method to find the least squares between the measured and calculated values over time, which may encounter some problems such as the overfitting of model parameters and a lack of reproducibility, especially when handling noisy data or error data. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) based kinetic modeling method is introduced, which can fully utilize a historical reference database to build a moderate kinetic model directly dealing with noisy data but not trying to smooth the noise in the image. Also, due to the database, the presented method is capable of automatically adjusting the models using a multi-thread grid parameter searching technique. Furthermore, a candidate competition concept is proposed to combine the advantages of the ML and IF modeling methods, which could find a balance between fitting to historical data and to the unseen target curve. The machine learning based method provides a robust and reproducible solution that is user-independent for VOI-based and pixel-wise quantitative analysis of dynamic PET data.

In this regard, the data for a real-world scene acquired by ground-based laser scanners are comprehensive and convenient, thus potentially meeting this requirement. To get an accurate result and offer an automatic solution for sunlight analysis, this paper proposes a solar potential analysis method that is run directly on 3-D ground laser scanning point clouds. Our method simulates natural illumination, sunlight hours, and solar radiation of the targeted scene for a specified period. This method first extracts the region of interest (ROI) to obtain targeted points. Then, we compute solar position as a virtual light source and propose a control method acting on the ROI to constraint deviation from the point light source. Finally, we adopt the generalized hidden point removal algorithm to cast shadow of obstruction on the ROI. Besides, experiments to validate the shading method results are carried out for three different periods. The quantitative results in the Xiamen case evaluated by the Hausdorff distance demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of our proposed method.

1388,"A visible light-active, hematite-based photoelectrode platform for suppressing -amyloid (A) self-assembly in vitro is reported. Upon illumination of a light-emitting diode with an anodic bias, the hematite photoanode generates reactive radical species, such as superoxide ions and hydroxyl radicals, via photoelectrocatalytic process. According to our analyses, the hematite photoanode exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on A aggregation under visible light illumination and anodic bias. We found that hole-derived radicals played a significant role of oxidizing A peptides, which effectively blocked further aggregation. The efficacy of photoelectrocatalytic inhibition on A aggregation was enhanced by introducing cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as a co-catalyst on the hematite photoanode, which facilitated the separation of electron-hole pairs. We verified that both bare and Co-Pi@hematite photoanodes are biocompatible and effective in reducing A aggregation-induced cytotoxicity.

This solar-assisted fluidized bed dryer integrated biomass furnace was used to investigated the drying kinetics of paddy. The average temperature of the air drying were 61 and 78 degrees C. The paddy's moisture content was dried to 14% from 20% (wet basis) with a mass flow rate of 0.125 kg/s. The performance of the fluidized bed drying system was assessed base on energy and exergy analyses. The specific energy consumption (SEC), solar fractions, biomass fractions, thermal and exergy efficiencies were obtained. The SEC and drying times were lower in hybrid solar-biomass fluidized bed drying system compared to solar dryers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1390,"Accumulating evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) are crucial regulators of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). TGF-beta signaling is a major inducer of EMT and can facilitate lung cancer metastasis. However, the role of lncRNAs in this process remains largely unknown. Here, we have identified 291 IncRNAs which were differentially expressed in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Of these, the gene body or vicinity of 19 transcripts were also bound by SMAD3. The expression of LINC01186 was significantly decreased in A549 cells treated with TGF-beta. Furthermore, LINC01186 was stably down-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared with normal tissues in TCGA data sets and another published lung cancer data sets. The bioinformatics analysis suggested that LINC01186 was associated with TGF-beta and might participate in EMT process. Moreover, knocking-down LINC01186 promoted cell migration and invasion, whereas, LINC01186 overexpression prevented cell metastasis. Importantly, LINC01186 expression was regulated by SMAD3. And LINC01186 affected several EMT markers expression. These findings suggest that LINC01186, a mediator of TGF-beta signaling, can play a significant role in the regulation of EMT and lung cancer cell migration and invasion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

1391,"A new high-accuracy current-mode function generator circuit will be presented, the proposed computational structure being designed for implementing a multitude of circuit functions with many applications in VLSI designs. The realization of the original function generator is based on the utilization of a new third-order approximation function that allows to strongly reduce the approximation error for the implemented functions. The circuit requires a much smaller silicon area comparing to similar previouslys reported circuits. The current-mode operation and the independence of the output current of the function generator on technological parameters and on temperature variations additionally increase the overall circuit accuracy. The simulations confirm the theoretical estimated results, showing an accuracy of the functional squaring core equal with 0.97 %. The new proposed function generator based on the third-order approximation function permits to obtain a wide output dynamic range of 28dB for a maximal error of 1dB, when implementing the exponential function. The proposed function generator is designed for a low-voltage operation, being supplied at V-DD=1V.

(Method) The proposed methods first extracted 64 color histogram to obtain color information, and 16 wavelet packet entropy to obtain the texture information. With the aim of reducing the 80 features, principal component analysis was harnessed. The reduced features were used as input to generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM). Winner-takes-all (WTA) was used to handle the multiclass problem. Two kernels were tested, linear kernel and Radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Ten repetitions of 10-fold stratified cross validation technique were used to estimate the out-of-sample errors. We named our method as GEPSVM + RBF + WTA and GEPSVM + WTA. (Result) The results showed that PCA reduced the 80 features to merely five with explaining 99.90% of total variance. The recall rate of GEPSVM + RBF + WTA achieved the highest overall recall rate of 97.9%. (Conclusion) This was higher than the result of GEPSVM + WTA and other five state-of-the-art algorithms: back propagation neural network, RBF support vector machine, genetic neural-network, linear discriminant analysis, and fitness-scaling chaotic artificial bee colony artificial neural network.

1393,"A new method for obtaining random bijective S-boxes based on discrete chaotic map is presented. The proposed method uses a discrete chaotic map based on the composition of permutations. The obtained S-boxes have been tested on the number of criteria, such as bijection, nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, output bits independence criterion, equiprobable input/output XOR distribution and maximum expected linear probability. The results of performance test show that the S-box presented in this paper has good cryptographic properties. The advantage of the proposed method is the possibility to achieve large key space, which makes it suitable for generation of S-boxes for larger values of n. Also, because this method uses discrete chaotic map based on the composition of permutations which has finite space domain, there is no need for discretization of continuous values of chaotic map, so the process of generation of S-boxes is not affected by approximations of any kind.

Here, we employed independent component analysis (ICA) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in resting state fMRI on a sample of 35 schizophrenia patients, 20 first-degree relatives and 35 control subjects. Analysis on ICA-derived networks revealed increased functional connectivity between the left frontoparietal network (FPN) and left temporal and parietal regions in schizophrenia patients (P < 0.001). First-degree relatives shared this hyperconnectivity, in particular in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG; P = 0.008). DCM analysis was employed to further explore underlying effective connectivity. Results showed increased inhibitory connections to the left angular gyrus (AG) in schizophrenia patients from all other nodes of the left FPN ( P < 0.001), and in particular from the left SMG (P - 0.001). Relatives also showed a pattern of increased inhibitory connections to the left AG (P = 0.008). Furthermore, the patient group showed increased excitatory connectivity between the left fusiform gyrus and the left SMG (P = 0.002). This connection was negatively correlated to inhibitory afferents to the left AG (P = 0.005) and to the negative symptom score on the PANSS scale (P = 0.001, r = -0.51). Left frontoparietotemporal dysfunction in schizophrenia has been previously associated with a range of abnormalities, including formal thought disorder, working memory dysfunction and sensory hallucinations.

1396,"A SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOY (SMA) is expected to be applied as intelligent or smart material since it shows the functional characteristics of the shape memory effect and superelasticity. Most SMA elements, with these characteristics, perform cyclic motions. In these cases, the fatigue property of SMA is one of the most important issues in view of evaluating functional characteristics of SMA elements. The fatigue proper ties are complex since they depend on stress, strain, temperature and their hysteresis. If an SMA is implanted with high-energy ions, the thermomechanical properties of the material may change, resulting in long fatigue life. In the present study, the nitrogen ion implantation was applied to modify the surface of a TiNi SMA tape and the influence of implantation treatment on the bending fatigue properties was investigated.

The first day of the workshop focused on the physiology of the blood and neuro-vascular unit, blood or biofluid-based molecular markers, extracellular vesicles associated with brain injury, and how these entities can be employed to better evaluate injury states and/or deliver therapeutics. The second day of the workshop focused on technical advances in in vitro models, BBB manipulations and nanoparticle-based drug carrier designs, with the goal of improving drug delivery to the central nervous system. The presentations and discussions underscored the role of the BBI in brain injury, as well as the role of the BBB as both a limiting factor and a potential conduit for drug delivery to the brain. At the conclusion of the meeting, the participants discussed challenges and opportunities confronting BBI translational researchers. In particular, the participants recommended using BBI translational research to stimulate advances in diagnostics, as well as targeted delivery approaches for detection and therapy of both brain injury and disease.

1398,"A long literature in demography has debated the importance of place for health, especially children's health. In this study, we assess whether the importance of dense settlement for infant mortality and child height is moderated by exposure to local sanitation behavior. Is open defecation (i.e., without a toilet or latrine) worse for infant mortality and child height where population density is greater? Is poor sanitation is an important mechanism by which population density influences child health outcomes? We present two complementary analyses using newly assembled data sets, which represent two points in a trade-off between external and internal validity. First, we concentrate on external validity by studying infant mortality and child height in a large, international child-level data set of 172 Demographic and Health Surveys, matched to census population density data for 1,800 subnational regions. Second, we concentrate on internal validity by studying child height in Bangladeshi districts, using a new data set constructed with GIS techniques that allows us to control for fixed effects at a high level of geographic resolution. We find a statistically robust and quantitatively comparable interaction between sanitation and population density with both approaches: open defecation externalities are more important for child health outcomes where people live more closely together.

1399,"According to Israeli law, citizens aged 20-40 are obligated to fulfill military reserve duty in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Guided by the theory of conservation of resources (COR; Hobfoll, 2001), this study examined the association of resource loss and gain (economic, time, familial, work, and personal resources) with level of reserve combat soldiers' distress and satisfaction with their service following the termination of their reserve duty. The sample consisted of 139 male Israeli citizens, ages 23-40, serving as reserve soldiers in the IDF. Using an Internet-based questionnaire, prior to the start of their reserve duty (Time 1), the respondents completed questionnaires assessing psychological traits, social support, and psychological distress. Following the reserve service period (Time 2), the respondents completed a short inventory of resource loss and gain related to the service, and assessments of psychological distress and satisfaction with the service. The main results showed that resource loss was higher on average than resource gain and was associated positively with distress and negatively with satisfaction with the service, whereas resource gain was positively associated with satisfaction only. The findings are compatible with COR theory and point to areas in which reserve soldiers could be assisted in fulfilling the task of maintaining national security while simultaneously preserving personal well-being.

The first one establishes the routes to be followed by the vehicles, based on a proposal of estimation of the travel times. The second one is formed by a system able to recognize and trace the drugs inside each vehicle. A laboratory experimentation has been conducted in order to demonstrate the adequacy of the route calculator.

This paper proposes the use of a combinatorial optimization problem as the way to model problems. Due to the fact that distributor's clients are located in different cities, the proposal considers travel times both between cities and inside the city. In addition, rush hours are also taken into account, in order to provide a more realistic model.

1403,"A Summary: Families that are at psychosocial risk live under personal and contextual circumstances that hinder their parenting skills. They frequently lack the resources necessary for addressing the challenges of parenting and encounter multiple stressful life events. Social support may help diminish the parenting stress that is experienced from living in a disadvantaged environment by enhancing coping strategies. However, previous research examining the associations between parenting stress and social support among at-risk families has been inconclusive. This study analyzed the psychosocial profile of at-risk Portuguese families, the size and composition of their social support networks and the associations between social support and parenting stress. Participants consisted of 167 parents (80% mothers) who received assistance from Child Protection Services. Measures included the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, the Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule and a socio-demographic questionnaire. Findings: Parenting stress levels were extremely high, with 44.51% of parents showing clinically significant levels. Emotional support was the type of support that was most closely related to parental distress, namely the network size available for providing emotional support (r=-.27, p=.000) and satisfaction with the emotional support received (r=-.24, p=.006). Applications: The size of the emotional support network was significantly smaller among parents who reported clinically significant levels of parenting stress. Hence, having the opportunity to express feelings and concerns as well as engaging in social interactions during leisure time may serve as protective factors against parental stress in at-risk families. Implications of for the interventions of professionals who work with at-risk families are discussed.

1404,"A new stochastic finite element model calibration framework for estimation of the uncertainty in model parameters and predictions from the measured frequency responses is proposed in this paper. It combines the principles of bootstrapping with the technique of FE model calibration with damping equalization. The challenge for the calibration problem is to find an initial estimate of the parameters that is reasonably close to the global minimum of the deviation between model predictions and measurement data. The idea of model calibration with damping equalization is to formulate the calibration metric as the deviation between the logarithm of the frequency responses of FE model and a test data model found from measurement where the same level of modal damping is imposed on all modes. This formulation gives a smooth metric with a large radius of convergence to the global minimum. In this study, practical suggestions are made to improve the performance of this calibration procedure in dealing with noisy measurements. A dedicated frequency sampling strategy is suggested for measurement of frequency responses in order to improve the estimate of a test data model. The deviation metric at each frequency line is weighted using the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured frequency responses. The solution to the improved calibration procedure with damping equalization is viewed as a starting value for the optimization procedure used for uncertainty quantification. The experimental data is then resampled using the bootstrapping approach and the FE model calibration problem, initiating from the estimated starting value, is solved on each individual resampled dataset to produce uncertainty bounds on the model parameters and predictions. The proposed stochastic model calibration framework is demonstrated on a six degree-of-freedom spring-mass system prior to being applied to a general purpose satellite structure.

1405,"Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) has been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions including asthma, allergic inflammation and food processing. AMCase is most active at pH 2.0, and its activity gradually decreases to up to pH 8. Here we analyzed chitin degradation by AMCase in weak acidic to neutral conditions by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis established originally for oligosaccharides analysis. We found that specific fragments with slower-than-expected mobility as defined by chitin oligosaccharide markers were generated at pH 5.0 similar to 8.0 as by-products of the reaction. We established an improved method for chitin oligosaccharides suppressing this side reaction by pre-acidification of the fluorophore-labeling reaction mixture. Our improved method specifically detects chitin oligosaccharides and warrants quantification of up to 50 nmol of the material. Using this strategy, we found that AMCase produced dimer of N-acetyl-n-glucosamine (G1cNAc) at strong acidic to neutral condition. Moreover, we found that AMCase generates (GIcNAc)(2) as well as (GIcNAc)(3) under physiological conditions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1407,"Aberrant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) accumulation has been shown to impair mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are a diverse group of non-selective Ca2+ channels, among which TRPC3 is the only one that is localized in mitochondria and plays a role in maintaining the normal MMP. This raises a possibility that altered TRPC3 expression may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by alpha-syn accumulation. To demonstrate this possibility, we first examined the expressions of mitochondrial TRPC3 in the brains of aging monkeys and alpha-syn transgenic and wild-type mice. We showed that alpha-syn levels increased in mitochondria in an age-dependent manner that was positively correlated to an elevation of mitochondrial TRPC3. This correlation was more prominent in the striatum than in the cerebellum, possibly due to the greater age-dependent alpha-syn accumulation in the striatum than in the cerebellum. We then used primary neurons overexpressing alpha-syn to investigate the effect of the alpha-syn-induced elevation of mitochondrial TRPC3 on the MMP and apoptotic cell death. We found that neurons with overexpressed alpha-syn had increased mitochondrial TRPC3 and decreased MMP, which were accompanied by increased number of apoptotic neurons. Suppressing TRPC3 expression partially reversed the reduction of MMP and alleviated the apoptotic cell death, indicating that the mitochondrial TRPC3 may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons with alpha-syn accumulation that may occur in not only the aged brain but also the brain with PD.

LDL is a more general learning framework which includes both single-label and multi-label learning as its special cases.

In order to compare the performance of the LDL algorithms, six representative and diverse evaluation measures are selected via a clustering analysis, and the first batch of label distribution datasets are collected and made publicly available. Experimental results on one artificial and 15 real-world datasets show clear advantages of the specialized algorithms, which indicates the importance of special design for the characteristics of the LDL problem.

1409,"A new method of reliability monitoring of electrical devices based on carbon fibres is presented. Due to the thermo-mechanical stress on electronic circuits a loss of fibre network integrity can take place and potential difference may appear between the edges of broken carbon fibres. This potential difference causes an intensive field-emission from surfaces of these broken carbon fibres and an acceleration of emitted electrons. Due to the acceleration of electrons a microwave emission is generated. A CFRP was used to simulate the behaviour of a carbon based electronic device. The sequence of microwave impulses was detected in a frequency bandwidth from 8 to 12 GHz. The rise time of detected microwave impulses is about of few nanoseconds. This time is in agreement with crack formation time in carbon fibre. The correlation between the change of electrical resistance of composites and microwave impulses by fibres fracture is observed. Thus, the breakdown of current that flows through carbon fibres induces detectable microwave emission. That means that defects in electrical circuits can be wireless detected online.

The MFCA is composed of a 3D channel network that simultaneously flows fluids through forty-eight 830 mu m by 500 mu m flow cells, which physically divide and fluidically seal an existing culture into multiple compartments when docked onto the surface of a cell or tissue culture dish. The modified system provides temperature (37 degrees C) and CO2/pH level controls, while continuously flowing solutions (media or other liquid such as drug suspensions) over the cells/tissues. These assays were enhanced and validated using inverted microscopy and fluorescent staining techniques which also allow real time viability and toxicity assessments. This work presents the results of this new generation in vitro drug testing assay performed using this modified MFCA system. This setup allows the testing of 48 drug combinations on 48 different cell-, tissue specimen at once under flow conditions. All 48 flow cells were utilized to test 5 different concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP). CDDP solutions in various concentrations were continually flowed over cultured human ovarian cancer cells for 48 h. Viability assessments were performed using red-orange calcein and SYTOX (R) Green nucleic acid stains. Cells were imaged at the beginning and end of the experiment (48 h). In order to compare and validate MFCAs suitability as drug screening assay, MTT assays were performed on cells. We found that both, MTT and MFCA assays generated dose-response curves with similar profiles. Innovative advantages of the MFCA system include the ability of handling smaller amounts of solutions compared to conventional and current state of the art drug screening and cell viability/toxicity methods. It also provides the ability to continually deliver fresh solution to the cell samples, while eliminating wastes that are produced. Based on our here reported findings MFCA may have a strong potential of providing a more physiological model than current state of the art static MTT assays.

The proposed technique is based on a combination of Floquet theory for propagation in periodic structures and reflect-array principles. A flat surface designed to reflect a TE polarized wave incident at 45 degrees back in the direction of the impinging signal at 14.7 GHz is employed as an example. By means of full-wave simulations, it is demonstrated that the monostatic RCS of a finite reflector is comparable with the specular RCS of a metallic mirror of the same dimensions. It is further shown that comparably high monostatic RCS values are obtained for angles of incidence in the 30 degrees-60 degrees range, which are frequency dependent and thus open opportunities for target localization. A prototype array is fabricated and experimentally tested for validation. The proposed solution can be used to modify the radar cross section of a target.

The design of this new sensor allows continuous, long term measurements without the need of periodic maintenance or physical adjustments of the measurement device. The new system measures changes of fruit or stem perimeter rather than diameter, thus yielding a more relevant information about the growth of objects which are intrinsically not of perfectly circular cross-sectional shape. The described sensor is very lightweight and does not require any mechanical frame or support structure. The tested prototypes had a measurement resolution of 0.5 mm of perimeter, corresponding to a resolution of about 0.16 mm of diameter for a spherical object.

In the present study, we sought to examine adaptations in adrenoceptor expression and function under conditions of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1r) deletion using knockout (KO) mice and compare these to wild type (WT) controls. Electrophysiological analysis of alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in mPFC slices in WT mice showed a clonidine-induced a2-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in mPFC cell excitability coupled with an increase in input resistance. In contrast, CB1r KO mice showed an alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in mPFC cell excitability. We then examined protein expression levels of alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor subtypes in the mPFC as well as TH expression in the locus coeruleus (LC) of mice deficient in CB1r. Both alpha 2- and inadrenoceptors exhibited a significant decrease in expression levels in CB1r KO mice when compared to WT in the mPFC, while a significant increase in TH was observed in the LC. To better define whether the same cortical neurons express alpha 2A-adrenoceptor and CB1r in mPFC, we utilized high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. We localized alpha 2A-adrenoceptors in a knock-in mouse that expressed a hemoagglutinin (HA) tag downstream of the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor promoter. Although the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor was often identifiedpre-synaptically, we observed co-localization of CB1r with alpha 2-adrenoceptors post-synaptically in the same mPFC neurons. Finally, using receptor binding, we confirmed prior results showing that alpha 2A-adrenoceptor is unchanged in mPFC following acute or chronic exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, but is increased, following chronic treatment followed by a period of abstinence. Taken together, these data provide convergent lines of evidence indicating cannabinoid regulation of the cortical adrenergic system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1417,"A titanium-based alloy with applications as implantable material was chemically graved through different methods, in order to improve the adhesion of a thin hydroxyapatite (HA) film. The aim of this study is to increase the biocompatibility of a metallic material by deposition of a ceramic material on his surface. The metallic material, known as titanium Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V), was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, with a SE detector for 2 and 3D images) and an Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyser (EDAX), after chemical attack and after HA deposition. Hydroxyapatite was deposited using electrophoretic equipment, each time using the same experimental conditions, so that a comparison can be made. After deposition, the material was calcined and some mechanical properties were investigated. The experimental results present a homogeneous layer formed with a very good adhesion and dimensionally reduced particles. The metallic material, used as dental implant, presents a better corrosion resistance in simulated body fluid electrolyte and the EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) tests emphasize the formation of two layers, a compact one of TiO2 (titanium oxide) and a porous one of HA on top of the surface.

1418,"A warming climate is anticipated to increase the future heat-related total mortality in urban areas. However, little evidence has been reported for cause-specific mortality or nonurban areas. Here we assessed the impact of climate change on heat-related total and cause-specific mortality in both urban and rural counties of Jiangsu Province, China, in the next five decades. To address the potential uncertainty in projecting future heat-related mortality, we applied localized urban- and nonurban-specific exposure response functions, six population projections including a no population change scenario and five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and 42 temperature projections from 21 global-scale general circulation models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Results showed that projected warmer temperatures in 2016-2040 and 2041-2065 will lead to higher heat-related mortality for total non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory, stroke, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes occurring annually during May to September in Jiangsu Province, China. Nonurban residents in Jiangsu will suffer from more excess heat-related cause-specific mortality in 2016-2065 than urban residents. Variations across climate models and RCPs dominated the uncertainty of heat-related mortality estimation whereas population size change only had limited influence. Our findings suggest that targeted climate change mitigation and adaptation measures should be taken in both urban and nonurban areas of Jiangsu Province. Specific public health interventions should be focused on the leading causes of death (stroke, IHD, and COPD), whose health burden will be amplified by a warming climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1419,"A critical step in metastases formation is cancer-cell invasion through tissue. During invasion, cells change morphology and apply forces to their surroundings. We have previously shown that single, metastatic breast-cancer cells will mechanically indent a synthetic, impenetrable polyacrylamide gel with physiological-stiffness in attempted invasion; benign breast cells do not indent the gels. In solid tumors, e.g., breast cancers, metastases occur predominantly by collective cell-invasion. Thus, here we evaluate the effects of cell proximity on mechanical invasiveness, specifically through changes in gel indention. Gel indentation is induced by 56, 33 and 2% (in >1000 cells), respectively, of adjacent high metastatic potential (MP), low MP and benign breast cells, being double the amounts observed in single, well-separated cells. Single cells exhibited a distribution of indentation depths below 10 A mu m, while adjacent cells also showed a second peak of deeper indentations. The second peak included 65% of indenting high MP cells as compared to 15% in the low MP cells, illustrating the difference in their invasiveness. Thus, proximity of the metastatic cells enhances their mechanical ability to invade, demonstrating why collective cancer-cell migration is likely more efficient. This could potentially provide a rapid, quantitative approach to identify metastatic cells, and to determine their metastatic potential.

1420,"Aggregation and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A beta) protein is a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we compared the anti-aggregatory and neuroprotective effects of five synthetic compounds against A beta protein; four of which possessed a five membered heterocycle ring scaffold (two dibenzyl phenyl imidazolidines and two triazole sulfanyl acetamides) and one with a fused five membered heterocycle (benzoxazole) ring, selected thorough virtual screening from ZINC database. Molecular docking of their optimized structures was used to study A beta binding characteristics. As predicted from molecular docking, strong steric binding of imidazolidines and H-bonding of both triazoles to A beta were translated into anti A beta aggregation properties. Subsequent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to assess their effects on A beta(1-42) fibril formation. Four compounds variably altered morphology of Ab fibrils from long, intertwined fibrils to short, loose structures. Thioflavin T assay of A beta fibrillisation kinetics demonstrated that one imidazolidine and both triazole compounds inhibited A beta aggregation. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were exposed to A beta(1-42), alone and in combination with the heterocyclic compounds to assess neuroprotective effects. A beta(1-42)-evoked loss of neuronal cell viability was significantly attenuated in the presence of both imidazolidine compounds, while the triazole acetamides and benzoxazole compound were toxic to PC12 cells. These findings highlight the A beta anti-aggregative and neuroprotective propensity of a dibenzyl phenyl imidazolidine scaffold (Compound 1 and 2). While the triazole sulfanyl acetamide scaffold also possessed A beta anti-aggregation properties, they also demonstrated significant intrinsic neurotoxicity. Overall, the predictive efficacy of in silico methods enables the identification of novel imidazolidines that act both as inhibitors of A beta aggregation and neurotoxicity, and may provide a further platform for the development of novel Alzheimer's diseasemodifying pharmacotherapies.

Each participant carried a microaethalometer to measure BC concentrations for 24 h while their whereabouts and microenvironments (MEs) were recorded via a time-activity diary (TAD) and follow-up interviews. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to compare average BC levels by potential risk factors including demographic, temporal, residential, and indoor/outdoor/transportation activity variables. The children's average daily exposure was 1.93 g/m(3), with a range of 0.2-85.43 g/m(3) (mean daily individual exposure ranges from 0.54 to 4.80 g/m(3)). Even children attending the same elementary school reported BC exposures which differed by approximately 40%, primarily because of individually distinct time-activity patterns and the MEs with which each child interacted. On weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) (1.86 2.50 g/m(3)) and holidays (Saturdays, Sundays, and vacation) (1.71 2.48 g/m(3)), children were subject to reduced exposures to BC, likely due to decreased surrounding traffic volumes and different time-activity patterns on weekend days compared to on weekdays (from Mondays to Fridays) (1.95 2.44 g/m(3)) or school days (weekdays during the school semesters) (2.05 2.43 mu g/m(3)). Commuting in diesel vehicles (often to private academies) or in the subway, cooking, and environmental tobacco smoke were all found to elevate BC exposure. Likewise, proximity to traffic sources and parental indoor smoking contributed to the enhancement of residential BC concentrations. Our findings suggested a need to emplace proactive measures including diesel fleet regulation and smoking cessation campaigns to protect children from high levels of BC exposure.

1423,"A reliable, accurate noninvasive method for identifying patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the primary care setting is needed. A population-based case-finding instrument may assist managed care organizations in identifying candidates for disease management or quality improvement programs. Our aim was to develop and validate a GERD case-finding instrument. A 12-item ""GERD Screener"" was developed based on literature review and expert opinion with questions about heartburn and regurgitation frequency and severity and medication use, as well demographics and exclusion criteria. Categorical and continuous scoring methods with and without medication use were developed a priori. Using a telephone interview in a medical group, we identified and enrolled 100 subjects with a history of GERD-like symptoms and 103 controls. Each subject completed the GERD Screener, a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire, the Digestive Health Symptom Index (DHSI), and was evaluated independently by two gastroenterologists using a structured format. Agreement by the two physicians that symptoms were consistent with GERD and required an intervention was considered the gold standard. In all, 70 subjects were classified as having GERD and 106 as controls using the gold standard (kappa = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.82). The scoring method for the screening instrument using a continuous measure of GERD symptoms (frequency and severity) and weighted medication use resulted in an area under ROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94). Using a cutoff of >9 points, this measure was 83% sensitive and 83% specific. Compared to the gold standard, the DHSI GERD subscale has an area under ROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94). The GERD Screener was highly correlated with the DHSI GERD subscale, r = 0.78 (95% CI 0.72-0.83; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, the GERD Screener has demonstrated construct, convergent, and predictive validity. It is shorter than existing validated instruments, practical, and easily administered, which may reduce the response and administrative burden. This may serve as a valuable case-finding instrument in primary-care and managed-care organizations wishing to implement programs to improve the quality and efficiency of care.

1424,"Afferent input from A delta and C-fibres innervating the urinary bladder are processed differently by the brain, and have different roles in signaling bladder sensation. A delta fibres that signal bladder filling activate a spino-bulbo-spinal loop, which relays in the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) and pontine micturition centre (PMC). The excitability of this circuitry is regulated by tonic GABAergic inhibitory processes. In humans and socialised animals micturition is normally under volitional control and influenced by a host of psychosocial factors. Higher nervous decision-making in a social context to 'go now' or 'do not go' probably resides in frontal cortical areas, which act as a central control switch for micturition. Exposure to psychosocial stress can have profoundly disruptive influence on the process and lead to maladaptive changes in the bladder. During sleeping the voiding reflex threshold appears to be reset to a higher level to promote urinary continence. Under physiological conditions C-fibre bladder afferents are normally silent but are activated in inflammatory bladder states and by intense distending pressure. Following prolonged stimulation visceral nociceptors sensitise, leading to a lowered threshold and heightened sensitivity. In addition, sensitization may occur within the central pain processing circuitry, which outlasts the original nociceptive insult. Visceral nociception may also be influenced by genetic and environmental influences. A period of chronic stress can produce increased sensitivity to visceral pain that lasts for months. Adverse early life events can produce even longer lasting epigenetic changes, which increase the individual's susceptibility to developing visceral pain states in adulthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The excess reproductive morbidity associated with obesity may increase with longer duration, making the current trends among children and young adults particularly critical in terms of their future reproductive potential. Obese women have a lower chance of pregnancy following in vitro fertilization (IVF), require higher dosages of gonadotropins, and have reduced rates of implantation, clinical intrauterine gestation, and live birth rates and increased rates of pregnancy loss, as well as greater risks for prematurity and preeclampsia even when stratified by plurality. Racial and ethnic differences by overweight and obesity in IVF outcomes have been reported. Compared with normal-weight women, failure to achieve a clinical intrauterine gestation is significantly more likely among obese women overall, normal-weight and obese Asian women, normal-weight Hispanic women, and overweight and obese Black women. Among women who do conceive, compared with normal-weight women, failure to achieve a live birth is significantly more likely among overweight and obese women overall, and among overweight and obese Asian women, overweight and obese Hispanic women, and normal-weight and obese Black women. Although weight loss should theoretically be the first line of therapy for obese women, other lifestyle factors, such as regular physical exercise, elimination of tobacco use and alcohol consumption, and stress management, may be of more immediate benefit in achieving conception.

1426,"A single-stage AC-AC converter has been designed for a wind energy conversion system (WECS) that eliminates multistage operation and DC-link filter elements, thus resolving size, weight, and reliability issues. A simple switching strategy is used to control the switches that changes the variable-frequency AC output of an electrical generator to a constant-frequency supply to feed into a distributed electrical load/grid. In addition, a modified random sinusoidal pulse width modulation (RSPWM) technique has been developed for the designed converter to make the overall system more efficient by increasing generating power capacity and reducing the effects of inter-harmonics and sub-harmonics generated in the WECS. The technique uses carrier and reference waves of variable switching frequency to calculate the firing angles of the switches of the converter so that the three-phase output voltage of the converter is very close to a sine wave with reduced THD. A comparison of the performance of the proposed RSPWM technique with the conventional SPWM demonstrated that the power generated by a turbine in the proposed approximately increased by 5% to 10% and THD reduces by 40% both in voltage and current with respect to conventional SPWM.

1427,"A new large dynamic-range variable gain amplifier (VGA) with improved dB linearity is presented. The traditional cascade VGA has the disadvantages of gain mismatch between sub-stages and difficulty of employing mismatch cancelation or suppression algorithms. In this paper, switch arrays were used to make the sub-stages or called gain cells in the coarse-tuning stage (CTS) work independently and therefore prevent the integral operation of the gain errors. Then, a second-order mismatch-shaping DEM was applied conveniently to the CTS and shown to be a useful design technique in improving the dB-linearity performance. The cascade VGA and its second-order mismatch-shaping DEM had been integrated in a 2.4-GHz receiver chip which was fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology with a supply voltage of 1.8V. Measurement results showed that the gain errors were significantly reduced with second-order mismatch-shaping DEM with respect to the traditionally thermometric decoding over a temperature range of [-40, 80] degrees C.

This study combined high resolution-data with a GIS system to analyze the impact of agricultural practices, crop type, and spatial factors such as drainage basins, climate, and soil type on the Water Footprint (WF) of agricultural crops. The area of the study, the northern Lower Jordan Valley, covers 1121 ha in which three main plantation crops are grown: banana (cultivated in open-fields or net-houses), avocado and palm-dates. High-resolution data sources included GIS layers of the cultivated crops and a drainage pipe-system installed in the study area; meteorological data (2000-2013); and crop parameters (yield and irrigation recommendations). First, the study compared the WF of the different crops on the basis of yield and energy produced as well as a comparison to global values and local irrigation recommendations. The results showed that net-house banana has the lowest WF based on all different criteria. However, while palm dates showed the highest WF for the yield criteria, it had the second lowest WF for energy produced, emphasizing the importance of using multiple parameters for low and high yield crop comparisons. Next, the regional WF of each drainage basin in the study area was calculated, demonstrating the strong influence of the Gray WF, an indication of the amount of freshwater required for pollution assimilation. Finally, the benefits of integrating GIS and WF were demonstrated by computing the effect of adopting net house cultivation throughout the area of study with a result a reduction of 1.3 MOM irrigation water per year. Integrating the WF methodology and local high-resolution data using GIS can therefore promote and help quantify the benefits of adopting site appropriate crops and agricultural practices that lower the WF by increasing yield, reducing water consumption, and minimizing negative environmental impacts.

1430,"A Non-Technical Loss (NTL) fraud occurs when a fraudster tampers with a smart meter so that the meter registers less electricity consumption than the actual consumed amount, and therefore the utility becomes the victim who suffers the corresponding economic loss. In the literature, many detection schemes have been proposed to detect NTL frauds. However, some NTL frauds are far more complicated than what the existing schemes expect. We recently discovered a new potential type of frauds, a variant of NTL frauds, called Colluded Non-Technical Loss (CNTL) frauds in the Smart Grid. In a CNTL fraud, multiple fraudsters can co-exist or collaborate to commit the fraud. Existing detection schemes cannot detect CNTL frauds since these methods do not consider the co-existing or collaborating fraudsters, and therefore cannot distinguish one from many fraudsters. In this paper, we propose a CNTL fraud detector to detect CNTL frauds. The proposed method can quickly detect a tampered meter based on recursive least squares. After identifying the tampered meter, the proposed scheme can detect different fraudsters using mathematical models. Our experiments show that our method is effective in detecting CNTL frauds.

1432,"Amino acids present a great potential for heavy metals sorption, thanks to their active chemical groups. Tyrosine is an amino acid containing amine, carboxylate and phenol groups and thus is a potential candidate for heavy metals remediation. However, this biomolecule is water soluble, and so it is difficult to remove tyrosine-metal complexes from the water. A potential solution would consist in grafting this biomolecule onto a material to ensure a good separation between heavy metals, trapped by tyrosine-grafted-material, and the water medium. Thus, the grafting of tyrosine onto a polypropylene (PP) nonwoven was carried out. Evidence of the grafting of tyrosine was given by several characterization techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A 3.2% tyrosine grafting rate was obtained. Then, the sorption efficiency of the tyrosine-functionalized material was evaluated by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. At 20 degrees C and for pH 4.5, approximately 48 mg of copper per gram of PP were trapped, confirming the good efficiency of tyrosine. The most interesting result of this study is the constant sorption capacity whatever the sodium chloride concentration in the copper sulfate solution. This result, specific to tyrosine, allows considering the possibility of the use of such material for marine wastewaters and sediments depollution.

The surface water and groundwater were sampled for hydrochemical analysis. Three electrical resistivity tomography profiles were conducted to evaluate the impact of leachate on the groundwater environment, and several laboratory tests were carried out to build the relationship between the soil bulk resistivity and the void fluid resistivity. The results showed that a seasonal creek named Longfeng creek, which crosses the landfill site, was contaminated by the leachate. The concentrations of COD, BOD5, and chlorides (Cl) of surface water samples increased by 12.3-105.7 times. The groundwater quality in the surface loose sediments along the valley deteriorated obviously from the landfill to 500 m downstream area. The laboratory tests of soil samples indicated that the resistivity value of 13 Omega m is a critical value whether the groundwater in the loose sediments is polluted. The groundwater at the site adjacent to the spillway in the landfill was partially contaminated by the emission of leachate.

For incompressible and fully developed flows, the governing equations of fluid flow are decoupled from temperature, and the velocity field is obtained analytically. The full-wave electromagnetic and the transient conjugate heat transfer analyses are coupled through temperature-dependent material properties. The efficiency of the co-simulation is enhanced through an adaptive time-stepping scheme, a domain decomposition scheme called the finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI), and FETI-enabled parallel computing.

1445,"A low-cost mini tubular microbial fuel cell (MFC) was developed for treating groundwater that contained benzene in monitoring wells. Experimental results indicate that increasing the length and density, and reducing the size of the char particles in the anode effectively reduced the internal resistance. Additionally, a thinner polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel separator and PVA with a higher molecular weight improved electricity generation. The optimal parameters for the MFC were an anode density of 1.22 g cm(-3), a coke of 150 mu m: an anode length of 6 cm, a PVA of 105,600 g mol(-1), and a separator thickness of 1 cm. Results of continuous-flow experiments reveal that the increasing the sets of MFCs and connecting them in parallel markedly improved the degradation of benzene. More than 95% of benzene was removed and electricity of 38 mW m(-2) was generated. The MFC ran continuously up to 120 days without maintenance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1446,"A droplet electroporation system has been successfully demonstrated for transfection of Jurkat T cell with much higher transfection efficiency (66%) than that of conventional system (11.4%) with the advantages of superior cell viability, comparable throughput, and user-friendly interface. Because the productivity of the proposed system is much greater than previous microfluidic systems, flow cytometry is used for the analysis of transfection efficiency. The high transfection efficiency and cell viability of the droplet electroporation system is mainly attributed to small size which requires lower voltage and provides concentrated environment. The successful transfection of Jurkat cell using the droplet electroporation system broadens the applicability of the proposed technology to medical field. The implication of the present work and the future development direction for a fully automated cell engineering platform are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1447,"A power operated detrasher was developed for removal of green top as well as dry trash from the harvested sugarcane stalks. It consisted of mechanisms for cane feeding, detrashing and delivery. It separates the top from the cane by breaking it from the natural weak point at the joint of immature top with mature cane stalks. It can be transported on three point linkage of the tractor and operated by an electric motor, diesel engine or tractor PTO. Performance of the equipment was evaluated by feeding different varieties of harvested canes, with their tops first, to the detrashing rollers through the feeding chute. The trash left on the cane after passing through the detrasher varied from 1.5 to 6.6 %. Trash removal efficiency varied from 77.5 to 94.5 % depending upon the variety. The output of the detrasher was 2.4 t/h. There was a saving of about 17 % in cost of operation and 84 % in labour requirement using the detrasher as compared to manual method.

However, current LASs have several problems, and most of these services do not last. This study proposes an optimization-based approach for enhancing the sustainability of an LAS. In this paper, problems related to optimizing an LAS system are presented.

Existing methods applicable to solving an LAS optimization problem are also reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are then discussed as a motive for combining multiple optimization methods in this study, as illustrated by an example.

1449,"A new methodology to determine the safety of suspension bridge main cables is proposed in this paper and illustrated by simulating the failure of a corrosion-deteriorated cable composed of 9,061 wires. The approach is the first to use a finite-element (FE) model to predict the failure load, account for load recovery due to friction in broken wires, and simulate the reduced strength of the cable as a three-dimensional random field. To obtain cable failure load, the load is increased gradually, causing individual wires break according to their residual strength variability. Because of the load transfer to surrounding wires, the breakage of an individual wire affects the stress state of its surrounding wires. Consequently, as the load is increased, this local damage spreads to its immediate vicinity, and eventually the entire cable fails. Because of the complexity of the problem, the critical failure load is determined through a Monte Carlo simulation approach that accounts for the uncertainty in the spatial variability of the residual strength of the individual wires. The probability distribution of the load that will drive a suspension bridge cable to failure is reported and investigated in the paper. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

1450,"Agricultural water scarcity is a major limiting factor for crop production in dry land regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite notable efforts of developing macro-catchment rainwater harvesting (RWH) techniques, few studies have evaluated the performance of RWH for deficit supplemental irrigation of crops. We examine the agro-meteorological risks such as late onset, early cessation, overall low rainfall amounts and long dry spells during the growing season and evaluate the potential of macro-catchment RWH for supplemental irrigation of onion in the southern dry lands of Ethiopia. Field experiments were undertaken during 2012 and 2013 to evaluate the effects of 50% ETc, 75% ETc and 100% ETc irrigation levels on yield and water productivity of onion during dry and wet seasons. The harvestable yield and water productivity of onion under 75% ETc irrigation were not significantly lower than that under 100% ETc irrigation during both the dry and wet seasons. Thus, deficit supplemental irrigation of onion at 75% ETc can be implemented with macro-catchment RWH to reduce the risks of crop failure and significant yield declines in dryland areas.

1451,"A wide variety of large-scale data have been produced in bioinformatics. In response, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been partly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many bioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses because of factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new generations of storage devices have emerged, such as NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs), and with the renewed interest in near-data processing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can accompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement of hard disk drives by SSDs results in dramatic speedup. Despite the various advantages and continuous cost reduction of SSDs, there has been little review of SSD-based profiling and performance exploration of important but time-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform in-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using multiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research, we further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics algorithms and pipelines to fully exploit SSDs. The programs we profile cover traditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly, mapping, expression analysis, variant calling and metagenomics. We explain how acceleration by parallelization can be combined with SSDs for improved performance and also how using SSDs can expedite important bioinformatics pipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. We hope that this review can provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics algorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful storage devices.

1454,"A major cause of fatal construction accidents is falls from height (FFH). In this study, the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) was adopted and modified to assist in classifying the root causes of fatal FFH accidents in Hong Kong. The characteristics and root causes of the accidents were analyzed using frequency analysis. The associations among the causes were examined using Fisher's exact test and latent class analysis (LCA). The cases apparently share some common characteristics and certain HFACS factors are closely associated. According to LCA results, the factors in all the cases may be placed into four classes, named as ill planning, violation, hidden hazards created by others, and incapable staffing. Recommendations are made to reduce FFH construction accidents based on the characteristics and root causes. The paper contributes to the body of knowledge in construction management by developing a modified HFACS framework for extracting structured information from construction accident reports, finding the general characteristics and managerial causes behind the FFH accidents, and using LCA to identify the connections among the managerial causes.

Distributed computing like Map-Reduce framework in cloud environment can provide a promising solution to this problem by processing the data in parallel on a large amount of computing nodes. In this paper, we parallelize power flow calculation based on Map-Reduce programming framework and evaluate the efficiency. T he classic NewtonRaphson method commonly used in power flow calculation is totally parallelized. To solve sparse linear equations in Map-Reduce framework, the factorization tree is carefully partitioned and in turn, all the variables in subtrees which are independent with each other can be calculated in parallel. Moreover, to map the proposed algorithm into MapReduce jobs, we also define the appropriate formats for the input, intermediate and output data.

1456,"A robust sparse least-mean mixture-norm (LMMN) algorithm is proposed, and its performance is appraised in the context of estimating a broadband multi-path wireless channel. The proposed algorithm is implemented via integrating a correntropy-induced metric (CIM) penalty into the conventional LMMN algorithm to modify the basic cost function, which is denoted as the CIM-based LMMN (CIM-LMMN) algorithm. The proposed CIM-LMMN algorithm is derived in detail within the kernel framework. The updating equation of CIM-LMMN can provide a zero attractor to attract the non-dominant channel coefficients to zeros, and it also gives a tradeoff between the sparsity and the estimation misalignment. Moreover, the channel estimation behavior is investigated over a broadband sparse multi-path wireless channel, and the simulation results are compared with the least mean square/fourth (LMS/F), least mean square (LMS), least mean fourth (LMF) and the recently-developed sparse channel estimation algorithms. The channel estimation performance obtained from the designated sparse channel estimation demonstrates that the CIM-LMMN algorithm outperforms the recently-developed sparse LMMN algorithms and the relevant sparse channel estimation algorithms. From the results, we can see that our CIM-LMMN algorithm is robust and is superior to these mentioned algorithms in terms of both the convergence speed rate and the channel estimation misalignment for estimating a sparse channel.

1458,"A brain network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala plays important roles in developmentally regulated cognitive and emotional processes. However, very little is known about the maturation of mPFC-amygdala circuitry. We conducted anatomical tracing of mPFC projections and optogenetic interrogation of their synaptic connections with neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at neonatal to adult developmental stages in mice. Results indicate that mPFC-BLA projections exhibit delayed emergence relative to other mPFC pathways and establish synaptic transmission with BLA excitatory and inhibitory neurons in late infancy, events that coincide with a massive increase in overall synaptic drive. During subsequent adolescence, mPFC-BLA circuits are further modified by excitatory synaptic strengthening as well as a transient surge in feedforward inhibition. The latter was correlated with increased spontaneous inhibitory currents in excitatory neurons, suggesting that mPFC-BLAcircuit maturation culminates in a period of exuberant GABAergic transmission. These findings establish a time course for the onset and refinement of mPFC-BLA transmission and point to potential sensitive periods in the development of this critical network.

Although these governments have made significant efforts toward creating profits from the stadiums, it is proving to be too difficult for several administrations to cover their full operational, maintenance, and conservation costs. In order to overcome this problem, one of the governments, Seogwipo City, which owns Jeju World Cup Stadium (JWCS), is attempting to provide an independent renewable electricity generation system for the operation of the stadium. The current study therefore examines potential configurations of an independent renewable electricity generation system for JWCS, using HOMER software. The simulation results yield three optimal system configurations with a renewable fraction of 1.00 and relatively low values for the cost of energy ($ 0.405, $ 0.546, and $ 0.692 per kWh). Through the examination of these three possible optimal configurations, the implications and limitations of the current study are presented.

1460,"A new hysteresis window method is proposed as a solution for avoiding the operational dead zone that exists at the transition between buck and boost operating modes in all noninverting buck-boost converters. In addition, this method also eliminates the discontinuities in the converter's steady-state output voltage transfer characteristic, which is a function of the duty cycle. The converter's output voltage function is surjective and, therefore, smooth mode transitions are achieved. The negative effects of operating within the dead zone are shown by the presence of subharmonics in the output voltage, increased output voltage ripple, poor regulation, and the instability of the converter during the transition between buck and boost operating modes. The dead-zone avoidance technique proposed in this paper eliminates all these issues while at the same time ensures highly efficient operation of the converter. An additional advantage of the technique is its simplicity, which allows for implementation into low-cost digital signal controllers, as well as into analog control circuits. The advantageous features of the proposed approach were evaluated on the basis of comparisons with three other dead-zone avoidance approaches and the initial case, which does not utilize any dead-zone avoidance technique. All the experiments were carried out on a purpose-built prototype of a noninverting buck-boost converter with magnetically coupled inductors.

A new entropy-based measure, named the centred error entropy (CEE) index, which is a weighted combination of the error cross-correntropy (ECC) criterion and the error entropy criterion (EEC), is proposed to tune the NN-PID controller. The purpose of introducing CEE in controller design is to ensure that the uncertainty in the tracking error is minimised and also the peak value of the error probability density function being controlled toward zero. The NN-controller design based on this new performance function is developed and the convergent conditions are investigated using a linearisation technique. During the control process, the CEE index is estimated by a Gaussian kernel function. Adaptive rules are developed to update the kernel size in order to achieve more accurate estimation of the CEE index. This NN cascade control approach is applied to superheated steam temperature control of a simulated power plant system, from which the effectiveness and strength of the proposed strategy are discussed by comparison with NN-PID controllers tuned with EEC and ECC criterions.

1463,"A novel zero attraction affine projection sign algorithm (ZA-APSA) for strong impulsive and sparse environment is proposed in this paper. Here norm penalty is introduced to original cost function of APSA which provides zero attraction to the filter weights. The APSA provides lower computational complexity and is robust against impulsive noise, whereas the ZA-APA works well in sparse environment with improved convergence and lower steady-state error. The proposed ZA-APSA combines the feature of APSA and ZA-APA, and hence, it provides faster convergence and lesser steady-state error with high robustness to impulsive interference with low computational complexity than the conventional ones. The stability condition for the convergence in the mean and mean square error sense is derived. Theoretical analysis is made to prove that the proposed algorithm can achieve lesser steady-state mean square error than APSA. Simulations are performed to validate the analysis made and to prove the suitability of the proposed algorithm for sparse and impulsive system identification.

To reveal the significant importance and smart-material functionality of the energetic-energetic co-crystals, the stability, mechanical and explosive properties TNT/CL-20 co-crystal, TNT crystal and CL-20 crystal were studied. Non-hydrogen bonded non-covalent interactions govern the structures of energetic-energetic co-crystals. However, it is very difficult to accurately calculate the non-covalent intermolecular interaction energies. In this paper, the local conformation and the intricate non-covalent interactions were effectively mapped and analyzed from the electron density (rho) and its derivatives. The results show that the two components TNT and CL-20 are connected mainly by nitro-aromatic interactions, and nitro-nitro interactions. The steric interactions in TNT/CL-20 could not be confronted with the attractive interactions. Moreover, the scatter graph of TNT crystal reveals the reason why TNT is brittle. The detailed electrostatic potential analysis predicted that the detonation velocities (D) and impact sensitivity for the compounds both increase in the sequence of CL-20 >TNT/CL-20 co-crystal >TNT. Additionally, TNT/CL-20 co-crystal has better malleability than its pure components. This demonstrates the capacity and the feasibility of realizing explosive smart materials by co-crystallization, even if strong hydrogen bonding schemes are generally lacking in energetic materials.

The cases of study are voltage followers (VFs) and a current-feedback operational amplifier (CFOA), where the width (W) and length (L) of the MOSFETs are selected from the space of feasible solutions computed by swarm or evolutionary algorithms. The evaluation of three objectives, namely: gain, bandwidth and power consumption; is performed using HSPICE (TM) with standard integrated circuit (IC) technology of 0.35 mu m for the VFs and 180nm for the CFOA. Therefore, the intersection procedure among three fuzzy sets representing ""gain close to unity"", ""high bandwidth"" and ""minimum power consumption"", is presented. The main advantage relies on its usefulness to select feasible W/L sizes automatically but by considering deviation percentages from the desired target specifications. Basically, assigning a threshold to each fuzzy set does it. As a result, the proposed approach selects the best feasible sizes solutions to guarantee and to enhance the performances of the ICs in analog signal processing applications.

However, the DIN sources are poorly constrained. In this study, the contributions of major sources in the Taipei metropolitan area to the DIN export in the Danshui River were investigated. It is observed that ammonium is the major DIN species in the downstream reaches, resulting from the ammonium-dominated inputs of the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and rain water pumping stations (RWPS). DIN concentrations in the downstream (urban) reaches are substantially elevated. The upstream tributaries annually discharge similar to 2709 t DIN to the downstream reaches. However, the DIN discharge off the downstream reaches rises to similar to 17,918 t, resulting from the contribution of RWPS-collected water, i.e., similar to 14,632 t, and the effluents of two WWTP, i.e., similar to 577 t. RWPS-collected water inherently contains the contribution of atmospheric deposition, similar to 2937 t DIN.

Some steps to guarantee the solution's optimality are relaxed in the BFC algorithm, such that an incomplete backward branching scheme is considered for solving large sized problems. Additionally, a new branching criterion is considered, based on dynamically-guided and stage-wise ordering schemes, such that fewer Twin Node Families are expected to be visited during the execution of the so-called H-DBFC algorithm. The inner parallelization IH-DBFC of the new approach, allows to solve in parallel scenario clusters MIP submodels at different steps of the algorithm. The outer parallel version, OH-DBFC, considers independent paths and allows iterative incumbent solution values exchanges to obtain tighter bounds of the solution value of the original problem. A broad computational experience is reported for assessing the quality of the matheuristic solution for large sized instances. The instances dimensions that are considered are up to two orders of magnitude larger than in some other works that we are aware of. The optimality gap of the H-DBFC solution value versus the one obtained by a state-of-the-art MIP solver is very small, if any. The new approach frequently outperforms it in terms of solution's quality and computing time. A comparison with our Stochastic Dynamic Programming algorithm is also reported.

1475,"Al Jabal Al Akhdar, an arid mountain region in northern Oman, has experienced rapid development over the last decades, resulting in the deterioration of water resources. This paper applies the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework as an integrated environmental assessment tool to illustrate the cause-and-effect relationships for sustainable management of water resources in the area. The research aimed to examine social and ecological aspects of mountain water to explore optimal approaches for sustainable use and management. The water resources are affected by increasing drivers of population growth and socio-economic development, through agriculture, tourism, and urbanization, exerting pressures through overconsumption of water, coupled with the exogenous pressure of climate change. The decreased rainfall and increased water demand have resulted in the degradation of water quantity and quality. The declining state of the water resources and reduced area of cultivation have resulted in considerable losses in agricultural income. The Omani government has adopted some responses, including water development projects, acting to reduce pressures as well as to improve the state of water resources. The DPSIR analysis indicates that trade-offs should be made between economic development and the continued supply of water for the agro-ecological system; choices could be in the prioritization of drivers. A dependence on desalinated water will introduce a reliance on a non-renewable external energy supply and is unlikely to ensure water supply at the multi-century timescale of the social-ecological system. In addition, tourism is predominantly based around the disappearing agro-ecosystems which in turn are dependent on the supply of water. Therefore, efforts should be directed towards improving water-use efficiency through installing modern irrigation technology, water conservation methods, use of greywater and treated wastewater, and rainwater harvesting as well as integrated water resources management, and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.

1476,"A damage detection methodology is proposed by integrating a nonlinear recursive filter and a non-contact computer vision based algorithm to measure structural dynamic responses. A phase-based optical flow algorithm inspired by the motion magnification technique is used to measure structural displacements, and the unscented Kalman filter is used to predict structural properties such as stiffness and damping coefficients. This non-contact displacement measurement methodology does not require an intensive instrumentation process, does not add any additional mass to the structure which may skew measurements, and can measure more signals compared to traditional methods. This measurement methodology still needs improvement as a tool due to its higher noise level relative to traditional accelerometer and laser vibrometer measurements. In order to detect structural damage using measured displacements from video, an unscented Kalman filter is used to remove noise from the displacement measurement and simultaneously detect damage by identifying the current stiffness and damping coefficient values, given a known mass, which are used to detect damage. To validate the proposed damage detection method state-space equations are derived without external excitation input and experimental tests are carried out.

Furthermore, we develop a more robust algorithm using an appearance update model that approximates the change of state of occlusion and deformation. In particular, an adaptive update scheme is presented to make each process robust. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed 29 state-of-the-art trackers on 100 challenging sequences. Specifically, the results obtained with the proposed scheme were improved by 8% and 18% compared to those of the KCF tracker for 49 occlusion and 64 scale variation sequences, respectively. Therefore, the proposed tracker can be a robust and useful tool for object tracking when occlusion and scale variation are involved.

1479,"Analysts prototyping trading strategies often reuse previously computed values: both full problems and subproblems. Avoiding recomputing these would increase productivity. We built a memoization library that caches function computations to files to avoid recomputation. This should minimize the need for users to think about whether caching is appropriate while giving them control over speed, accuracy, and space usage. Guo and Engler built an automatic memoization library by modifying the Python interpreter, while jug and joblib are distributed computing libraries that do memoization. Our library attempts to maintain the ease of use of these libraries while offering a higher degree of control of how caching is carried out. It allows control of space usage for individual functions and all memoization, refreshing memoization for a specific function, and accuracy checking, and uses faster hashing and provides a divide and conquer approach to reuse previously computed subproblems. We show that for Markowitz optimization, Fama-French, and the singular value decomposition, memoization using our library greatly speeds up recomputation, often by over 99% versus no memoization and over 80% versus joblib. We also show how a divide-and-conquer memoization approach can give large speedups for sorting. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

1480,"Aiming at solving the problems on dynamic occlusion of complete denture in the field of dental restoration, this paper presents a computerized system from the viewpoint of integration of related disciplines. Firstly the displacement matrix of mandibular movement on Hanau articulator is established by means of the method of the direction cosine matrix in spatial mechanism. Secondly by programming in Matlab 6.5 (a language for technical computing), VC6.0 ++ and VTK (Visualization ToolKit), and adopting these techniques such as laser scanning, computer graphics, and computer database, a 3D digitized model of the denture has been reconstructed; And then the 3D coordinate data of mark points are measured. On basis of this digitized model, the computerized simulation system of occlusal contacts for complete denture is developed. With the aid of this system, the dynamic occlusive procedure of the complete denture mounted on Hanau articulator is clearly observed at any required angle and location of views, in addition, the posit ions of the occlusal contacts is obtained. Therefore this study is helpful to research on the dynamic occlusion of complete denture and improve dental restorative procedures.

1482,"Apache Hadoop is a widely used distributed computing framework and its file system is Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which assumes that DataNodes in a system are homogeneous in nature. When a cloud system scales up, DataNodes are very likely to become heterogeneous. Thus, extensive research has been placed on improving performance for heterogeneous Hadoop systems, but little attention has been placed on security improvements. This motivates us to investigate a data allocation scheme called the Secure HDFS (SecHDFS) by integrating the secret sharing technique to improve storage security in a heterogeneous Hadoop system. DataNodes in a Hadoop system are classified into a variety of different types of groups based on their vulnerability characteristics. SecHDFS addresses the increased risk issue caused by data replication in HDFS by allocating fragments of a file to as many different types of DataNodes as possible and multiple replicas of the same fragment to DataNodes of the same type. A storage assurance model is developed to evaluate the quality of security offered by SecHDFS. Analysis of the assurance model and performance evaluation experiments show that SecHDFS does not impact the performance of the Hadoop system that much in comparison with the default HDFS, while significantly improving data assurance in a heterogeneous environment.

The group delay profile of the complementary stub is smooth and continuous while at the same time maintaining a flat magnitude response over an ultra-wide bandwidth. Several units can be cascaded to obtain a desired group delay profile. This configuration can be used in analog signal processing or to reduce the signal distortion from other wideband components.

1484,"Anomaly detection in a large area using hyperspectral imaging is an important application in real-time remote sensing. Anomaly detectors based on subspace models are suitable for such an anomaly and usually assume the main background subspace and its dimensions are known. These detectors can detect the anomaly for a range of values of the dimension of the subspace. The objective of this paper is to develop an anomaly detector that extends this range of values by assuming main background subspace with an unknown user-specified dimension and by imposing covariance of error to be a diagonal matrix. A pixel from the image is modeled as the sum of a linear combination of the unknown main background subspace and an unknown error. By having more unknown quantities, there are more degrees of freedom to find a better way to fit data to the model. By having a diagonal matrix for the covariance of the error, the error components become uncorrelated. The coefficients of the linear combination are unknown, but are solved by using a maximum likelihood estimation. Experimental results using real hyperspectral images show that the anomaly detector can detect the anomaly for a significantly larger range of values for the dimension of the subspace than conventional anomaly detectors.

1485,"Ambient intelligence (Aml) worlds consist of heterogeneous collections of interconnected devices that integrate smoothly in the environment to offer services to their users. These devices can be added, change or fail, modifying the system topology. Also, other circumstances may change, affecting users' activities, e.g., time, location, or the presence of other users. These changes modify the information the system has available to satisfy users' needs, i.e., the context. Aml systems need to adapt to these evolving conditions in order to be able to provide their services, but being as unobtrusive as possible for their users. There are also performance requirements that the system must fulfill to provide responses to environment stimuli in real time. Opportunistic control mechanisms address these issues by monitoring the context, and suspending or resolving goals when the appropriate conditions are met. This paper presents FAERIE, a software framework that supports the development of Aml applications with facilities for context management that rely on opportunistic control. The development of FAERIE systems uses a 3D simulator tool for testing and validation called UbikSim. A case study on an artistic installation illustrates the use of this infrastructure.

Digitized delay, or digitized phase shift through the self-oscillating loop results in a very precise frequency control and ensures an optimum operation of the piezoelectric transformer in terms of voltage gain and efficiency. In this work, additional time delay is implemented digitally for the first time through 16 bit digital-to-analog converter to the self-oscillating loop. Delay control setpoints updates at a rate of 417 kHz. This allows the control loop to dynamically follow frequency changes of the transformer in each resonant cycle.

Fractal geometry has been used as a quantitative description of spatial complexity of remote sensing images. Yet, corn field of spatial irregularity alters the fractal dimension of the landscape, which shall be suppressed in the estimation. In this paper, we propose a method for computing fractal dimension from irregular region of interests that minimizes the contribution from 2-D spatial irregularity. Our method was evaluated with normalized difference vegetation index products derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and satellite pour l'observation de la terre VEGETATION sensors from three states in the U.S. The experimental results using the time series demonstrated that our proposed fractal dimension estimation method exhibited great consistency and invariance to the change of image spectral characteristics, spatial resolution, and the degree of pixel mixing. In contrast to entropy and variance, the spectral characteristics of different imaging devices exhibited lower impact to the fractal dimension, which also implies its scale invariance. With respect to the detection rate of the first peak, fractal dimension achieved the best consistency. The proposed method for computing fractal dimension provides a critical and reliable measure for studying phenological patterns.

1488,"A series of neurological and psychiatric symptoms occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with cognitive dysfunction being one of the most prominent sequela. Given that tau hyperphosphorylation is an important cause of cognitive impairment in patients of Alzheimer's disease, our present study detected the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), mainly at Ser404, in multiple brain regions, including the ipsilateral parietal cortex, contralateral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, immediately after the injury in a mouse TBI model; these changes lasted for at least 4w. All of these brain regions play important roles in working memory. Hyperphosphorylated tau protein was primarily located in neurons and was accompanied by axonal injury and dendritic spine degeneration. Our study demonstrated that p-tau spreads gradually and selectively from the injured cortex to other brain regions after TBI and that all of the affected regions are part of the working memory circuit. These findings provide experimental support for the role of p-tau in cognitive impairment in the early phase after TBI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1490,"A heuristic procedure based on novel recursive formulation of sinusoid (RFS) and on regression with predictive least-squares (LS) enables to decompose both uniformly and nonuniformly sampled 1-d signals into a sparse set of sinusoids (SSS). An optimal SSS is found by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization of RFS parameters of near-optimal sinusoids combined with common criteria for the estimation of the number of sinusoids embedded in noise. The procedure estimates both the cardinality and the parameters of SSS. The proposed algorithm enables to identify the RFS parameters of a sinusoid from a data sequence containing only a fraction of its cycle. In extreme cases when the frequency of a sinusoid approaches zero the algorithm is able to detect a linear trend in data. Also, an irregular sampling pattern enables the algorithm to correctly reconstruct the under-sampled sinusoid. Parsimonious nature of the obtaining models opens the possibilities of using the proposed method in machine learning and in expert and intelligent systems needing analysis and simple representation of 1-d signals. The properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated on examples of irregularly sampled artificial signals in noise and are compared with high accuracy frequency estimation algorithms based on linear prediction (LP) approach, particularly with respect to Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB).

Variance estimates are used to mix the outputs of the sub-filters, imparting variable gain and phase characteristics that permit it to automatically adapt to signal parameter changes. The proposed adaptive technique does not involve the estimation of plant parameters; therefore, it may be used in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations. In open-loop estimation problems, variable gain/bandwidth allows it to reduce the impact of random errors caused by sensor noise and the impact of bias errors caused by model mismatch during ` maneuvers'. In feedback control problems, variable phase/delay allows it to act as a lag filter for an improved steady-state response (i.e. greater noise attenuation) and act as a lead filter, or a proportionalderivative controller, for an improved transient response (i.e. increased closed-loop damping) for input discontinuities.

1498,"According to dichromatic reflection model, the previous methods of specular reflection separation in image processing often separate specular reflection from a single image using patch-based priors. Due to lack of global information, these methods often cannot completely separate the specular component of an image and are incline to degrade image textures. In this paper, we derive a global color-lines constraint from dichromatic reflection model to effectively recover specular and diffuse reflection. Our key observation is from that each image pixel lies along a color line in normalized RGB space and the different color lines representing distinct diffuse chromaticities intersect at one point, namely, the illumination chromaticity. For pixels along the same color line, they spread over the entire image and their distances to the illumination chromaticity reflect the amount of specular reflection components. With global (non-local) information from these color lines, our method can effectively separate specular and diffuse reflection components in a pixelwise way for a single image, and it is suitable for real-time applications. Our experimental results on synthetic and real images show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods to separate specular reflection.

Workers' comfort may be compromised in many labor situations, including those depending on environmental conditions, like extremely hot weather conduces to heat stress. Occupational heat stress (OHS) happens when a worker is in an uninterrupted physical activity and in a hot environment. OHS can produce strain on the body, which leads to discomfort and eventually to heat illness and even death. Related ISO standards contain methods to estimate OHS and to ensure the safety and health of workers, but they are subjective, impersonal, performed a posteriori and even invasive. This paper focuses on the design and development of real-time personalized monitoring for a more effective and objective estimation of OHS, taking into account the individual user profile, fusing data from environmental and unobtrusive body sensors. Formulas employed in this work were taken from different domains and joined in the method that we propose. It is based on calculations that enable continuous surveillance of physical activity performance in a comfortable and healthy manner. In this proposal, we found that OHS can be estimated by satisfying the following criteria: objective, personalized, in situ, in real time, just in time and in an unobtrusive way. This enables timely notice for workers to make decisions based on objective information to control OHS.

Recently, retention soil filters installed between stormwater storage basins and receiving surface waters in order to provide further treatment of combined sewer overflows were investigated.

Human responses to thermal environments and air quality created by different cooling modes were also studied. Totally 229 completed questionnaires were statistically analysed. The results show that most of the respondents prefer to use air conditioner 3-6 months in a year with relatively low temperature settings especially for respondents living below fifth floor. It is better to choose relatively high temperature settings to reduce air conditioning intensity especially for elders and outdoor workers, which can not only avoid cold thermal discomfort but also reduce electric energy use. For elders, outdoor workers and persons living in higher floor levels, there was an increase usage of electrical fans or natural ventilation.

Because of their genome-mutating activities, AID/APOBECs are also drivers of tumorigenesis. Due to highly charged surfaces, extensive non-specific protein-protein/nucleic acid interactions, formation of polydisperse oligomers, and general insolubility, structure elucidation of these proteins by X-ray crystallography and NMR has been challenging. Hence, almost all available AID/APOBEC structures are of mutated and/or truncated versions. In 2015, we reported a functional structure for AID using a combined computational-biochemical approach. In so doing, we described a new regulatory mechanism that is a first for human DNA/RNA-editing enzymes. This mechanism involves dynamic closure of the catalytic pocket. Subsequent X-ray and NMR studies confirmed our discovery by showing that other APOBEC3s also close their catalytic pockets. Here, we highlight catalytic pocket closure as an emerging and important regulatory mechanism of AID/APOBEC3s. We focus on three sub-topics: first, we propose that variable pocket closure rates across AID/APOBEC3s underlie differential activity in immunity and cancer and review supporting evidence. Second, we discuss dynamic pocket closure as an ever-present internal regulator, in contrast to other proposed regulatory mechanisms that involve extrinsic binding partners.

METHODS VSG is being performed more frequently worldwide as a treatment for medically-complicated obesity, and dysphagia is common post-operatively. We hypothesize that post-operative dysphagia is related to underlying medical conditions or narrowing of the gastric sleeve. This is a retrospective, single institution study of consecutive patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy from 2013 to 2015. Patients with previous bariatric procedures were excluded. Narrowing of a gastric sleeve includes: inability to pass a 9.6 mm gastroscope due to stenosis or sharp angulation or spiral hindering its passage. RESULTS Of 400 consecutive patients, 352 are included; the prevalence of dysphagia is 22.7%; 33 patients (9.3%) have narrowing of the sleeve with 25 (7.1%) having sharp angulation or a spiral while 8 (2.3%) have a stenosis. All 33 patients underwent balloon dilatation of the gastric sleeve and dysphagia resolved in 13 patients (39%); 10 patients (30%) noted resolution of dysphagia after two additional dilatations. In a multivariate model, medical conditions associated with post-operative dysphagia include diabetes mellitus, symptoms of esophageal reflux, a low whole blood thiamine level, hypothyroidism, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and use of opioids. CONCLUSION Narrowing of the gastric sleeve and gastric sleeve stenosis are common after VSG. Endoscopic balloon dilatations of the gastric sleeve resolves dysphagia in 69% of patients.

In two-stage bubble pump driven lithium bromide absorption refrigeration system, flow patterns in lifting pipe have significant effects on the performance of bubble pump. In this paper, the single bubble motion and the double bubbles coalescence in vertical ascending pipe are simulated by an improved free energy model of lattice Boltzmann method, in which the two-phase liquid to gas density ratio is 2778. The details of bubbles coalescence process are studied. Density and velocity of bubbles have been obtained. The computational results show that the initial radius of each bubble has a great influence on the coalescence time. The larger the initial bubble radius, the shorter the coalescence time. The pipe diameter has a little effect on the two bubbles coalescence time while it has a significant effect on the bubble velocity. As the pipe diameter increases, the bubble velocity increases. The obtained results are helpful for studying the transition mechanisms of two-phase flow patterns and useful for improving the bubble pump performance by controlling the flow patterns in lifting pipe.

Since fluctuating wind is wind speed changing with time in the atmosphere, it will cause the vibration of the structure. And pulsating wind reflects the atmospheric boundary layer wind disturbance and randomness. In the paper, Stable Type Suspension Bridge (STSB) is researched for buffeting problem. A finite element model of the bridge is set up using the finite element software. The buffeting response of the bridge is calculated and studied. The influence of the opposite tensional structures in the bridge on buffeting response of the bridge is assessed.

1514,"A recent biological study shows that the extremely good efficiency of fruit flies in finding food, despite their small brain, emerges by two distinct stimuli: smell and visual contrast. ""contrast-based fruit fly optimization"", presented in this paper, is for the first time mimicking this fruit fly behaviour and developing it as a means to efficiently address multi-parameter optimization problems. To assess its performance a study was carried out on ten mathematical and three truss optimization problems. The results are compared to those obtained using twelve state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and confirm its good and robust performance. A sensitivity analysis and an evaluation of its performance under parallel computing were conducted. The proposed algorithm has only a few tuning parameters, is intuitive, and multi-faceted, allowing application to complex n-dimensional design optimization problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1515,"A numerically robust approach to steady-state calibration of nonlinear dynamic models is presented. The approach is based on explicit formulation of the constraints on validity of internal model signals by set of inequalities. The constrained optimization with feasible iterates guarantees that the model will never be evaluated with invalid internal signals. This overcomes numerical difficulties often encountered when dealing with highly nonlinear models. Because the approach uses a large number of slack variables, distributed least squares algorithm is proposed. The robustness of this approach is demonstrated on a steady-state calibration of turbocharged diesel engine model starting from grossly inaccurate initial estimates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The design and architecture of this system, as well as possible application examples will be explained. One specific scenario is the operation in maritime frequency bands. A well-known service is the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which has been captured by the DLR mission AISat, and will be chosen as a maritime application example. The results of an embedded solution for AIS on the SDR platform are presented in this paper. Since there is an increasing request for more performance on maritime radio bands, services like AIS will be enhanced by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). The new VHF Data Exchange Service (VDES) shall implement a dedicated satellite link. This paper describes that the SDR with a flexible RF front end can be used as a technology demonstration platform for this upcoming data exchange service.

1517,"A novel frequency compensation technique, named Regular Miller plus Reversed Indirect Compensation (RMRIC), is presented in this paper for fast-settling three-stage amplifiers. The RMRIC topology includes, on the one hand, a Miller capacitor combined with one nulling resistor connected between the first stage and the third stage, and on the other hand, an indirect compensation capacitor in series with a resistor added between the first and the second stage, which improves remarkably the performance such as gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and sensitivity of the proposed amplifier. Detailed design considerations are carried out to demonstrate the stability of the compensation technique. Circuit simulation results show the amplifier driving a 2-pF load capacitance achieves a 9.25-GHz GBW dissipating only 16.5 mW with a 1.2 V supply voltage using a TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology, which shows a significant improvement in figure of merits. The implemented amplifier reaches a settling time of 3.35 ns with 0.006 % accuracy.

1518,"Adaptive deep brain stimulation uses feedback about the state of neural circuits to control stimulation rather than delivering fixed stimulation all the time, as currently performed. In patients with Parkinson's disease, elevations in beta activity (13-35 Hz) in the subthalamic nucleus have been demonstrated to correlate with clinical impairment and have provided the basis for feedback control in trials of adaptive deep brain stimulation. These pilot studies have suggested that adaptive deep brain stimulation may potentially be more effective, efficient and selective than conventional deep brain stimulation, implying mechanistic differences between the two approaches. Here we test the hypothesis that such differences arise through differential effects on the temporal dynamics of beta activity. The latter is not constantly increased in Parkinson's disease, but comes in bursts of different durations and amplitudes. We demonstrate that the amplitude of beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus increases in proportion to burst duration, consistent with progressively increasing synchronization. Effective adaptive deep brain stimulation truncated long beta bursts shifting the distribution of burst duration away from long duration with large amplitude towards short duration, lower amplitude bursts. Critically, bursts with shorter duration are negatively and bursts with longer duration positively correlated with the motor impairment off stimulation. Conventional deep brain stimulation did not change the distribution of burst durations. Although both adaptive and conventional deep brain stimulation suppressed mean beta activity amplitude compared to the unstimulated state, this was achieved by a selective effect on burst duration during adaptive deep brain stimulation, whereas conventional deep brain stimulation globally suppressed beta activity. We posit that the relatively selective effect of adaptive deep brain stimulation provides a rationale for why this approach could be more efficacious than conventional continuous deep brain stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and helps inform how adaptive deep brain stimulation might best be delivered.

1519,"An energy audit for one department at the faculty of Engineering and Technology at the University of Jordan has been conducted as a way to apply the concept of green building to an existing structure. According to the Jordanian green building code, a classification for the green building has been carried out according to its saving in energy and water in addition to the other factors such as indoor quality and material. The heating and cooling loads were calculated and the results were compared with the values for the same building after amendments to the windows and walls. The insulation for external walls of the building has been introduced in addition the double glazing instead of the current single glass windows for the building. The electricity for the lighting consumption of this building was obtained and analyzed and the potential of utilizing a lighting sensor for different halls and rooms was studied and analyzed. The boiler performance has been studied and an estimation of efficiency enhancement was proposed. It has been found that choosing a larger window area facing south, east and west can save more energy in winter and decreasing the heating costs using a certain types of double glazing, while decreasing the glazing area facing north can save money and energy. Also, it has been found that the payback period for the annual saving in fuel and electricity bills is less than 3 years. The needed investment for obtaining the energy saving is shown in the paper.

1521,"A well-established approach to developing new imaging agents and treatments for cancer begins with the recognition of receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells. Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (mu) and delta (delta) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or Tc-99m for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) or the delta-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEI( cells transfected with mu (HEK-mu) or delta (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity. These conjugates were abandoned from further development but information about their synthesis may be valuable to other laboratories working in this field. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1522,"Advancements in information, communication, and sensor technologies have led to new opportunities in medical care and education. Patients in general prefer visiting the nearest clinic, attempt to avoid waiting for treatment, and have unequal preferences for different clinics and doctors. Therefore, to enable patients to compare multiple clinics, this study proposes a ubiquitous multicriteria clinic recommendation system. In this system, patients can send requests through their cell phones to the system server to obtain a clinic recommendation. Once the patient sends this information to the system, the system server first estimates the patient's speed according to the detection results of a global positioning system. It then applies a fuzzy integer nonlinear programming-ordered weighted average approach to assess four criteria and finally recommends a clinic with maximal utility to the patient. The proposed methodology was tested in a field experiment, and the experimental results showed that it is advantageous over two existing methods in elevating the utilities of recommendations. In addition, such an advantage was shown to be statistically significant.

1523,"Aerodynamic and aeroelastic flutter-driven triboelectric nanogenerators are successfully used to harvest broadband airflow energy. The unit component of the flutter membrane consists of thin, free-standing Al foil electrodes covered on both sides with electrospun poly(vinyl chloride) nanofiber-structured mats, which provide advantageous tribo-surfaces specifically to increase the friction area. The airflow-induced triboelectric power generation from a single unit of the flutter-membrane-based triboelectric nanogenerator (FM-TENG) was up to 0.33 mu W under a mild airflow condition. The use of a multi-layered triboelectric nanogenerator, fabricated by simply stacking the single units, can improve the output performance of the device. In a separate configuration, we designed a novel FM-TENG structure by mounting an aeroelastic flutter-belt adapted for use with a fluttermembrane energy-harvester. A rubber belt, which was sandwiched between the flutter membranes, created a rapid periodic vibrational mode via aeroelastic fluttering, synergistically harvesting triboelectric energy with the application of a constant air stream through the closed channel of the FM-TENG. Thus, our flutter-membranebased approach creates a sustainable and cost-efficient energy harvesting system for collecting broadband airflow energy. Furthermore, the aerodynamic and aeroelastic FM-TENG have great potential to be used in numerous areas of self-powered electronic systems and in-situ wireless sensor applications for automobiles or aircraft.

1524,"A wealth of observational studies show that low testosterone is associated with insulin resistance and with an increased risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Experimental studies have identified potential mechanisms by which low testosterone may lead to insulin resistance. Visceral adipose tissue is an important intermediate in this relationship. Actions of testosterone or its metabolite oestradiol on other tissues such as muscle, liver, bone or the brain, and body composition-independent effects may also play a role. However, definitive evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether the association of low testosterone with disordered glucose metabolism is causative is currently lacking. It therefore remains possible that this association is due to reverse causation, or simply originates by association with common health and lifestyle factors. RCTs of testosterone therapy in men with or without diabetes consistently show modest metabolically favourable changes in body composition. Despite this, testosterone effects on glucose metabolism have been inconsistent. Recent evidence suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis suppression in the majority of obese men with metabolic disorders is functional, and may be, at least in part, reversible with weight loss. Until further evidence is available, lifestyle measures with emphasis on weight reduction, treatment of comorbidities and optimisation of diabetic control should remain the first-line treatment in these men. Such measures, if successful, may be sufficient to normalise testosterone levels in men with metabolic disorders, who typically have only modest reductions in circulating testosterone levels.

In addition, we found that the gray matter volume in the bilateral STG/MTG was negatively correlated with the duration of TN. These results provide compelling evidence for gray matter abnormalities in TN and suggest that the duration of TN may be a critical factor associated with brain alterations.

CD is often associated with several morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis/bone fractures, secondary infections, and increased cardiovascular mortality. While the majority (approximate to 80%) of the corticotrophinomas visible on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging are microadenomas (MICs,= 10 mm) with increased growth potential and invasiveness, exceptionally exhibiting malignant demeanor. In addition, larger and invasive MACs are associated with a significant increased risk of local complications, such as hypopituitarism and visual defects. Given the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of corticotrophinomas, the aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of genetic differential expression between MIC and MAC, including the invasiveness grade as a criterion for categorizing these tumors. In this study, were included tumor samples from patients with clinical, laboratorial, radiological, and histopathological diagnosis of hypercortisolism due to an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma. Differential gene expression was studied using an Affymetrix microarray platform in 12 corticotrophinomas, classified as non-invasive MIC (n = 4) and MAC (n = 5), and invasive MAC (n = 3), according to modified Hardy criteria. Somatic mutations in USP8 were also investigated, but none of the patients exhibited USP8 variants. Differential expression analysis demonstrated that non-invasive MIC and MAC have a similar genetic signature, while invasive MACs exhibited a differential expression profile. Among the genes differentially expressed, we highlighted CCND2, ZNF676, DAPK1, and TIMP2, and their differential expression was validated through quantitative real-time PCR in another cohort of 15 non-invasive and 3 invasive cortocotrophinomas. We also identified potential biological pathways associated with growth and invasiveness, TGF-beta and G protein signaling pathways, DNA damage response pathway, and pathways associated with focal adhesion. Our study revealed a differential pattern of genetic signature in a subgroup of MAC, supporting a genetic influence on corticotrophinomas in patients with CD.

It typically follows a chronic course and patients undergo longterm medical and surgical therapy. We set out to describe current surgical practice in the management of pCD in the UK. Method A survey of surgical management of pCD was designed by an expert group of colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists. This assessed acute, elective, multidisciplinary and definitive surgical management. A pilot of the questionnaire was undertaken at the 2015 meeting of the Digestive Disease Federation. The survey was refined and distributed nationally through the trainee collaborative networks. Results National rollout obtained responses from 133 of 179 surgeons approached (response rate 74.3%). At first operation, 32% of surgeons would always consider drainage of sepsis and 31.1% would place a draining seton. At first elective operation, 66.6% would routinely insert of draining seton, and 84.4% would avoid cutting seton. An IBD multidisciplinary team was available to 87.6% of respondents, although only 25.1% routinely discussed pCD patients. Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha therapy was routinely considered by 64.2%, although 44.2% left medical management to gastroenterologists. Common definitive procedures were removal of the seton only (70.7%), fistulotomy (57.1%), advancement flap (38.9%), fistula plug (36.4%) and ligation of intersphincteric track (LIFT) procedure (31.8%). Indications for diverting stoma or proctectomy were intractable sepsis, incontinence and poor quality of life. Conclusion This survey has demonstrated areas of common practice, but has also highlighted divergent practice including choices of definitive surgery and multimodal management.

In a national survey of people ages 20-59, we found no association between self-reported cannabis use and BMD of the hip or spine. Introduction Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in the USA, and its recreational use has recently been approved in several US states. Cannabinoids play a role in bone homeostasis. We aimed to determine the association between cannabis use and BMD in US adults. Methods In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010, 4743 participants between 20 and 59 years old, history of cannabis use was categorized into never, former (previous use, but not in last 30 days), light (1-4 days of use in last 30 days), and heavy (>= 5 days of use in last 30 days). Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between cannabis use and DXA BMD of the proximal femur and lumbar spine with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and race/ethnicity among other BMD determinants. Results Sixty percent of the population reported ever using cannabis; 47% were former users, 5% were light users, and 7% were heavy users. Heavy cannabis users were more likely to be male, have a lower BMI, increased daily alcohol intake, increased tobacco pack-years, andweremore likely to have used other illegal drugs (cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines). No association between cannabis and BMD was observed for any level of use (p >= 0.28). Conclusions A history of cannabis use, although highly prevalent and related to other risk factors for low BMD, was not independently associated with BMD in this cross-sectional study of American men and women.

1540,"Actual software project feasibility assessment is one of the foremost challenging and vital activities in estimating economics of software before its actual development. Therefore, prototyping in recent years, gradually become an approach to decide various options and possible outcomes before its real implementation and success of the projects. Most of the prototype studies in software engineering acts as a good pointer to envision and reflect upon the final product prediction. However, there has been dearth so far for a detailed economic analysis accountable for benefits, opportunities, risks and costs (BOCR) merits arising from various influencing factors (criteria and sub-criteria.). Further to determine the final possible outcomes (alternatives) through the trade-offs between the BOCR models. The present work attempts to close this gap. The modeling is performed in association with two types of models: analytic network process (ANP) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with complex relations between influencing factors. The former is illustrated as BOCR-ANP in the form of a control network and analysed through questionnaire based on expert judgement and historic data. The latter BOCR-AHP as a strategic hierarchy via real time data collected from the defect consolidation log data sets through linguistic variables proposed by same authors in our previous work. Thus we propose to investigate prototype dependability model through the inputs arising from expert judgement and real time data. More importantly our proposed model is realized without constructing actual working model. It is an analytical model based on inputs from past experience. The model can be a replacement for a working model for smaller/medium projects or additional inputs to strengthen working model for larger complex software systems. Thus our paper proposes a holistic model to assess the prototype dependability in software at prototype level in early in the software life cycle process. We carried over a case study to examine the proposed approach and to evaluate the economic feasibility of projects in I. T. industry.

1544,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are indivisible part of the innate immune system in invertebrates. AMPs have been proven to have crucial role with a wide range of biological activities, mainly with immunomodulatory and broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. The unique and salient features of the AMPs show its exceptional nature of therapeutic activity and serves as an alternative agent for conventional antibiotics. The search for potential AMPs persist, as the emergence of multiple drug resistant bacterial strains has been spreading in higher number. Here, the putative antimicrobial peptide sequences were identified from 19,915 sequences of prawn transcriptome and analyzed with various in silico tools such as EXPASY, AMPA, and helical wheel projection and so on. The characteristic antimicrobial properties have been determined for 660 putative AMPs with above mentioned tools. We have demonstrated an efficient bioinformatics approach to derive and analyze the AMPs from the transcriptome data of Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Even though, 660 peptide regions were identified among those five peptide sequences were demonstrated comprehensively with each characteristic property contributes the antimicrobial activity. In this study, we have proposed a rapid and successful protocol that would help to predict AMP in sequential procedure using various in silico methods. Also, we have shown a distinctive method to shortlist the AMPs based on their various physico-chemical properties. Until now, no sequential protocol has been developed to identify and characterize the AMPs from protein database.

The relaxation-oscillation equation is the primary equation of relaxation and oscillation processes. The relaxation oscillation equation is a fractional differential equation with initial conditions. In this paper, the approximate solutions of relaxation-oscillation equation are obtained by developing the wavelet collocation method to fractional differential equations using cubic B-spline wavelet. Analytical expressions of fractional derivatives in caputo sense for cubic B-spline functions are presented. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it transforms such problems into a system of algebraic equations which is suitable for computer programming.

This system is an innovative application of mobile commerce, ubiquitous computing, and ambient intelligence. The intended user is a traveler who must decide on the best service location along the planned route; the system arranges the service when the user demands it, so that when the user arrives at the service location the required service is ready. This system applies the ""just-in-time"" concept to mobile commerce, ubiquitous computing, and ambient intelligence. This innovation has great potential for providing better services in these fields. The issue of how to determine the JIT service location and path in a ubiquitous service network is critical; however, because data about the user's position is inaccurate, the task is difficult. To tackle this difficulty, a FINLP model is formulated, and a fuzzy version of Dijkstra's algorithm is proposed. A test system has been established to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Based on the experimental results, the proposed JIT ubiquitous service networked system was able to reduce the user's average waiting time by 74%.

We aimed to develop a practical profile based on serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be used to predict patients likely to respond to treatment. Microarrays were used to screen cisplatin-resistant SGC7901/DDP GC cells and the parental SGC7901 cell lines for miRNAs related to chemotherapy sensitivity. The correlation between the expression patterns of identified serum miRNAs and overall survival was confirmed in 68 GC patients. Furthermore, we also validated the signature of the serum miRNAs in an independent cohort of 50 GC patients. From the screening microarrays, we focused on miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-93 as downregulated miRNAs in the SGC7901/DDP cells and miR-27a, miR-106a and miR-664 as upregulated miRNAs. Only serum miR-106, miR-15a, miR-93 and miR-664 were useful in predicting the prognosis of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. We identified a signature of four serum miRNAs (miR-106, miR-15a, miR-93 and miR-664) that, when combined, can be used as a risk score for overall survival. Patients with a higher risk score had worse prognosis (p < 0.05). For the independent cohort of patients, the signature of the four miRNAs predicted prognosis well. Our data showed that the risk score derived from the four serum miRNAs was closely associated with the overall survival in GC patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy.

Thus, vibration suppression problem must be solved to guarantee the stability and control accuracy. A characteristic model based nonlinear golden section adaptive control (CMNGSAC) algorithm is implemented to suppress the vibration of a flexible Cartesian smart material manipulator driven by a ballscrew mechanism using an AC servomotor. The system modeling is derived to recognize the dynamical characteristics. The closed loop stability is analyzed based on the model. Also, an experimental setup is constructed to verify the adopted method. Experimental comparison studies are conducted for modal frequencies' identification and active vibration control of the flexible manipulator. The active vibration control experiments include set-point vibration control responses, vibration suppression under resonant excitation and simultaneous translating and vibration suppression using different control methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the controller can suppress both the larger and the lower amplitude vibration near the equilibrium point effectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

1554,"A field enquiry mentioned the potential positive impact of a feed restriction on the health of young rabbits, but no objective information relates the intake to digestive health. The effects of a post-weaning feed restriction strategy were thus studied on digestive health and growth and carcass parameters of the growing rabbit, using a monofactorial design that produces a quantitative linear reduction of the intake, from ad libitum (AL group) to 80%, 70% and 60% of AL. The study was performed simultaneously in six experimental sites, on 1984 growing rabbits (496 per treatment) collectively caged from weaning (34 to 38 days of age, depending on the site) to slaughter (68 to 72 days). The feeding programme was applied as followed: restriction during 21 days after weaning, and then ad libitum till slaughter During the feed restriction period the growth rate was linearly reduced with the restriction level, by 0.5 g/day for each percent of intake reduction. When returning to ad libitum intake (after 54 days old) a compensatory growth and a higher feed efficiency occurred. Therefore, the impact of the feeding programme on the slaughter weight (SW) was significant (-4.5 g/% of restriction), but relatively moderate: the weight loss of the more-restricted rabbits (60%) reached 7.7% (-200 g) compared to the AL group. Over the whole fattening period the feed restriction reduced linearly and significantly the feed conversion (FC) (-0.0077 unit/% of restriction). Carcass traits were little affected by the feeding programme, except for a slightly lower decrease of the dressing percentage (mean: 1.2 units between AL and the three restricted groups). On the six experimental sites, mortality and morbidity were always caused by acute digestive disorders, namely diarrhoea and/or caecal impaction. Independent of the treatment, the mortality rate strongly varied according to the site (between 7% and 18% from weaning to 54 days and for the AL group). During feed restriction, the mortality was significantly lower from a restriction threshold of 80% (meanly: -9% compared to AL). The morbidity was also significantly reduced (-6%) for the two most restricted groups (70% and 60%). The favourable effect of a lower intake on health did not persist after returning to ad libitum intake (54 days to slaughter), since mortality and morbidity were not significantly different among the treatments. Such a feeding strategy thus represents a double benefit in terms of feed costs and lower losses of young rabbits.

A comparison cohort comprising of patients without ARHL was frequency-matched by age, sex, and co-morbidities, and the occurrence of dementia was evaluated in both cohorts. The ARHL cohort consisted of 4108 patients with ARHL and the control cohort consisted of 4013 frequency-matched patients without ARHL. The incidence of dementia [hazard ratio (HR), 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI 1.14-1.49); P = 0.002] was higher among ARHL patients. Cox models showed that being female (HR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.07-1.68), as well as having co-morbidities, including chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, head injury, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, alcohol abuse/dependence, and tobacco abuse/dependence (HR, 1.27; 95% CI 1.11-1.45), were independent risk factors for dementia in ARHL patients. We found ARHL may be one of the early characteristics of dementia, and patients with hearing loss were at a higher risk of subsequent dementia. Clinicians should be more sensitive to dementia symptoms within the first 2 years following ARHL diagnosis. Further clinical studies of the relationship between dementia and ARHL may be necessary.

1557,"A novel approach is proposed in this study to eliminate the chaotic motion by a fuzzy controller and an appropriate dither. First, a back-propagation (BP) neural-network (NN) model is used to approximate the multiple time-delay chaotic system. Then, a linear differential inclusion (LDI) state-space representation is established for the dynamics of the NN model. Based on the LDI state-space representation, this study proposes a delay-dependent stability criterion derived in terms of Lyapunov's direct method to guarantee that the trajectories of the multiple time-delay chaotic (MTDC) system under fuzzy control can be steered into a periodic orbit. Subsequently, the stability condition of this criterion is reformulated into a linear matrix inequality (LMI). According to the LMI, a fuzzy controller is then synthesized to tame the multiple time-delay chaotic (MTDC) system. If the fuzzy controller cannot suppress the chaos, a high frequency signal, commonly called dither, is simultaneously injected to eliminate the chaotic motion by regulating the dither's parameters. If the frequency of dither is high enough, the trajectories of the dithered chaotic system and its corresponding mathematical model-the relaxed system can be made as close as desired. This make it possible to obtain a rigorous prediction of the dithered chaotic system's behavior by establishing the relaxed system. Finally, this study provides a numerical example of the Chen's chaotic system with simulations to illustrate the concepts discussed throughout this paper. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The methodology involves stereovision ranging, object detection and tracking, and minimization of tracking error due to image quantization limitations and pixel miscorrespondences in the stereo pixel-matching process. The method consists of combining a simple stereovision-matching algorithm, together with a predictive-corrective approach based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and use of suitable choices of probabilistic models representing the motion of the target vehicle and the stereovision measurements. Simple matching algorithms perform faster at the expense of potential errors in depth measurement. The approach considered aims to minimize the tracking errors related to such errors in stereovision measurements, thereby improving the accuracy of the state estimation of the vehicle. Results from simulations and a real-time implementation reveal the effectiveness of the system to compute accurate estimates of the state of the target vehicle over non-compliant trajectories subjected to a variety of motion conditions.

1560,"A three-degrees of freedom (3-DOF) coupled numerical simulation technique for synchronously extracting 18 aerodynamic derivatives of bridge decks is proposed and evaluated in this study. Computations are performed with a finite volume unstructured computational flow dynamics (CFD) solver using two-dimensional (2D) hybrid meshes with fine near-wall resolution. The accuracy of the numerical model is verified by identifying the aerodynamic derivatives of one thin plate section with theoretical solutions. Further, for two typical deck sections (streamlined and bluff) of two long-span bridges, the extracted 18 aerodynamic derivatives from both coupled and uncoupled techniques are compared. The results showed good agreement with the experimental results. The proposed 3-DOF coupled method can provide almost the same level of accuracy as the 1-DOF method and saves about 67% of the computation time. The appropriateness of the linear superposition theorem for the aeroelastic forces generated by different motions (single and coupled mode) is examined, and found that there are significant differences in both aerostatic and aeroelastic forces. Various high-order aeroelastic force components are successfully captured by the newly presented coupled numerical simulation, and the aerodynamic derivatives are proved to be immune to the high-order components mathematically. This knowledge is essential for a thorough evaluation of aerodynamic derivatives identification accuracy. The proposed technique and the analytical viewpoints presented in this paper may serve as the building block for developing new numerical tools and analytical frameworks for rapid and accurate evaluation of aerodynamic derivatives, and the response of long-span flexible bridges to wind excitation.

1561,"A novel estimator for the identification of continuous-time linear time-varying systems is presented in this paper. The estimator uses kernel-based regression to identify the time-varying coefficients of a linear ordinary differential equation, based on noisy samples of the input and output signals. The estimator adopts a mixed time- and frequency-domain formulation, which allows it to be formulated as the solution of a set of algebraic equations, without relying on finite differences to approximate the time derivatives. Since a kernel-based approach is used, the model complexity selection of the time-varying parameters is formulated as an optimisation problem with continuous variables. Variance and bias expressions of the estimate are derived and validated on a simulation example. Also, it is shown that, in highly noisy environments, the proposed kernel-based estimator provides more reliable results than an Oracle'-based estimator which is deprived of regularisation.

1562,"ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) is the alpha-secretase that is involved in APP(beta-amyloid precursor protein) processing. Enhancement of the nonamyloidogenic APP pathway by ADAM10 provides therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). By using high-throughput screening that targeted ADAM10, we determined that apicidin-an inhibitor of HDACs(histone deacetylases)-significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of ADAM10 in SH-SY5Y cells. A luciferase assay revealed that the nucleotides 2444 to 2300 in the ADAM10 promoter were sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, knockdown of USF1 (upstream transcription factor 1) and HDAC2/3 prevented apicidin regulation of ADAM10. Moreover, USF1 acetylation was increased by apicidin, which enhanced the association of USF1 with HDAC2/3 and with the ADAM10 promoter. We further found that apicidin did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK or USF1; however, ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked the effect of apicidin on ADAM10. Finally, apicidin increased the level of a-site C-terminal fragment from APP and reduced the production of b-amyloid peptide 1-42. Collectively, our study provides evidence that ADAM10 expression can be regulated by HDAC2/3 inhibitor apicidin via USF1-dependent mechanisms in which ERK signaling plays an important role.

The class of interest in this article is that of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. For this class a behavioural theory has already been developed by Blass and Gurevich, which unfortunately, though mathematically correct, fails to be convincing, as it is not intuitively clear that the postulates really capture the essence of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. In this article we present a much simpler (and presumably more convincing) set of four postulates for (synchronous) parallel algorithms, which are rather close to those used in Gurevich's celebrated sequential ASM thesis, i.e. the behavioural theory of sequential algorithms. The key difference is made by an extension of the bounded exploration postulate using multiset comprehension terms instead of ground terms formulated over the signature of the states. in addition, all implicit assumptions are made explicit, which amounts to considering states of a parallel algorithm to be represented by meta-finite first order structures. The article first provides the necessary evidence that the axiomatization presented in this article characterizes indeed the whole class of (synchronous) parallel algorithms, then formally proves that parallel algorithms are captured by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The proof requires some recourse to methods from finite model theory, by means of which it can be shown that if a critical tuple defines an update in some update set, then also every bther tuple that is logically indistinguishable defines an update in that update set.

We assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in April 2012 on Long Island, New York, within the Pine Barrens region, a unique but imperiled fire-dependent ecosystem in the northeastern United States. The mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales, for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images from bi-temporal pre- and post-fire event - WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. We first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the sub-crown scale per severity class (i.e. unburned, low, moderate, and high severity) from the post-fire 0.10 m color aerial ortho-photos; then, we validated the burn severity mapping of geo-referenced dominant tree crowns (crown scale) and 15 m by 15 m fixed-area plots (inter-crown scale) with the post-fire 0.10 m aerial ortho-photos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots. Our approach can accurately assess forest burn severity at the sub-crown (overall accuracy is 84% with a Kappa value of 0.77), crown (overall accuracy is 82% with a Kappa value of 0.76), and inter-crown scales (89% of the variation in estimated burn severity ratings (i.e. Geo-Composite Burn Index (CBI)).

1576,"Anonymous systems on the Internet aim to protect users from revealing to an external unauthorized entity their identities and their network activities. Despite using layered encryption, these systems are still vulnerable to timing analysis, wherein an eavesdropper can use traffic correlation mechanisms to identify the source of packets arriving at a destination. Mixes are intelligent routers or proxy servers that aim to provide packet source anonymity from timing analysis by delaying and shuffling the order of received packets prior to transmission. Such shuffling strategies naturally increase latency and result in a tradeoff between anonymity and latency. This paper investigates this tradeoff in a network of mixes, by deriving the optimal routing for sources which maximizes weighted sum of anonymity and delay. The achievable anonymity is characterized analytically for a general multipath model, and it is shown that under light traffic conditions, there exists a unique single route strategy, which achieves the optimal delay anonymity tradeoff. A low complexity algorithm is presented that derives the optimal routes to achieve a desired tradeoff. The light traffic results are specialized for a graphical model of existing practical anonymous systems, and optimal scaling behavior with the size of such networks is characterized. In the heavy traffic regime, it is shown that optimal anonymity is achieved for any allocation of rates across the different routes. Simulations on example networks are presented where it is shown that the optimal routes derived under light traffic performs quite well in general traffic regime.

1577,"4D printing, which is the combination of 3D printing technology and printable smart materials, provides the potential of automating actuation devices. In this paper, we have used a modifiedfused deposition modelling 3D printing technology to fabricate a double-layer laminate smart material, which can be activated by temperature directly or by an electric circuit indirectly. A double-layer laminate mathematical model has been developed to describe the bending behaviour caused by the mismatch strain between the surface layer and the basal layer. The electrocaloric deformation testings were performed to find the different bending rules of this low-cost printed active composite in different physical states. The considerable maximal deformation values and deformation force (7 mm and 100 mN for these carbon fibre (CF)/polylactic acid specimens, and 10 mm and 200 mN for these CF/polyether-ether-ketone specimens in the paper) provide this double-layer smart material and 4D printing method the prospective to be applied in biomimetic sensors, actuators, transducers, and artificial muscles.

1578,"Accessible Summary In England and Wales, some people with learning disabilities may have to be detained under the Mental Health Act 2007 as patients in a hospital for a period of assessment and or treatment if they are suffering from a mental disorder, and it is for the interests of their own health and safety, or to protect others. Patients who are detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2007 can apply to the Mental Health Tribunal to decide whether they should be detained in a psychiatric hospital or be discharged. The Mental Health Tribunal has the power to discharge these patients after a hearing. Patients who lack capacity to apply to the tribunal are unable to have a tribunal hearing. The European Court has ruled that this is unfair to these patients. There needs to be a system in place to ensure that these patients get a tribunal hearing. Abstract Background In the UK, the Mental Health Tribunal is a long-established safeguard for patients detained under the Mental Health Act. This gives such patients an effective appeal mechanism to ensure legal protection of their liberty. This act contains sections that allow for civil detention in the case of mental disorder. The right to apply to the tribunal against such detention is underpinned by the right to liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Some patients with learning disabilities may lack capacity and the ability to challenge their detention. Method This article presents a case study of a woman with Down's syndrome and severe learning disabilities. Whilst this woman was detained under the Mental Health Act, she could have applied for a review of her detention to the Mental Health Tribunal within 14days. She did not do so because she lacked capacity to instruct solicitors. Subsequently, as a result of appeal, the case proceeded through English and European judicial review. Results The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of MH v UK (2013), has ruled that the appeals procedure for patients without capacity detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act is not compatible with Article 5(4) of the European Convention of Human Rights. The European Court has ruled that special procedural safeguards are required to enable this cohort of patients to exercise their rights guaranteed by Article 5(4). Conclusions Responsible clinicians [treating consultant psychiatrists] need to ensure that all patients detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act have an assessment of their capacity to apply to the tribunal. There need to be systems in place to alert hospital managers when a patient lacks capacity to apply for a tribunal. Hospital managers should request the Secretary of State to apply for a tribunal in these instances. Knowledge of this ruling is relevant to informing the practice of other interdisciplinary healthcare professionals working with such patients.

1582,"A pilot project was conducted to examine the health status and possible adverse health effects associated with seawater exposure (microbial water-quality indicators and phytoplankton abundance and their toxins) of surfers in Monterey Bay, Central California coastal waters. Forty-eight surfers enrolled in the study and completed an initial health background survey and weekly health surveys online using Survey Monkey. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation, a regression technique, were used to identify longitudinal and correlated results. The surfers were predominately Caucasian, male, and physically active. They surfed approximately 4 h a week. Their average age was 34 years. The data indicated that the surfers were generally ""healthy,'' with a low prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Their most common health problems were allergies and asthma. During the study, 10% of the surfers reported gastrointestinal symptoms and 29% reported upper respiratory symptoms. This study suggests surfers were significantly more likely to report upper respiratory symptoms when they had a history of allergies, housemates with upper respiratory symptoms, and/or a history of previous adverse health symptoms while surfing during a ""red tide'' (an event often associated with the presence of phytoplankton toxins). Additionally, female surfers reported upper respiratory symptoms more than males.

1583,"A novel dynamic radio-cooperation strategy is proposed for a Cloud Radio Access Network (Cloud-RAN) consisting of multiple Remote Radio Heads connected to a central Virtual Base Station (VBS) pool. In particular, the key capabilities of Cloud-RAN in computing-resource sharing and real-time communication among the VBSs are leveraged to design a joint dynamic radio clustering and cooperative beamforming scheme that maximizes the downlink Weighted Sum-Rate System Utility (WSRSU). Due to the combinatorial nature of the radio clustering process and to the non-convexity of the cooperative beamforming design, the underlying optimization problem is NP-hard, and is extremely difficult to solve for a large network. The proposed approach aims for a suboptimal solution by transforming the original problem into a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Program (MI-SOCP) and applying Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) to derive a novel iterative algorithm. Numerical simulation results show that our low-complexity algorithm provides near-optimal performance in terms of WSRSU while significantly outperforming conventional radio clustering and beamforming schemes. Additionally, the results also demonstrate the significant improvement in computing-resource utilization of Cloud-RAN over a traditional RAN with distributed computing resources.

It includes the user as part of the construction process responding to the customer's demands and wishes. To the present day, almost all proposals for Mass Customisation have been focused on the design phase and single family houses. The reality is that the processes carried out in the work execution are so inefficient that the costs of the Mass Customisation models are assumed by the customer and they do not offer solutions that support the change management. Furthermore, this inefficiency often makes Mass Customisation unfeasible in terms of deadlines and site management. Therefore, the present proposal focuses on achieving the paradigm of Mass Customisation in the traditional residential construction complementary to the existing proposals in the design phase. All this through the proposal of a framework for the integral management in the work execution, which will address change management introduced by the users offering an efficient and productive model that reduces costs in the process.

Copper, Zn, Ni, Co, and Mn evaluated by enrichment factor (EF) indicated minor contamination due to water pollution accidents of the Huaihe River that occurred in 1990s and 2004. Lead presented the most severe pollution among the metals studied, especially during 1957-1974. The use of leaded petrol and atmospheric deposition of coal combustion flue gases could have contributed to Pb contamination. In spite of the general good quality (mean sediment pollution index (SPI) 35.69) of the sediment core evaluated by SPI based on the principal component analysis, worse sediment qualities in the upper section (<6 cm, 2004) were still observed, suggesting intensive human activities causing the increasing concentrations of metals in recent decades.

1586,"A Summary Twenty-five percent of patients with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture have an undiagnosed vertebral fracture detected by vertebral fracture assessment during bone densitometric assessment. The prevalence of an undiagnosed vertebral fracture is higher in older people, and they are more likely to have multiple vertebral fractures. Purpose Most vertebral fragility fractures (VFF) have no history of trauma. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) during dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can be used to detect these VFFs. This study aims to identify the prevalence of undiagnosed VFF in patients presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture. Methods Patients identified by the fracture liaison service (FLS) of a large UK university hospital presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture were evaluated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2015. Local protocol identified those that would proceed for VFA. Data was collected on patient characteristics, fracture details, bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and VFA results. Results Five hundred sixty-seven patients (mean (SD) age, 72 (9.4) years) of mostly women (88.3%) had a VFA performed as part of their DXA assessment. One hundred forty-three patients (25.2%) were identified to have a vertebral fracture, of whom 57.3% of them had one fracture. 49.5% of those with vertebral fractures had BMD measurements diagnostic of osteoporosis. Mean (SD) age was higher in those with vertebral fractures compared to those without; 74.9 (8.3) years vs 70.4 (9.5) years, p < 0.00. Those aged 75 years and over were more likely to have multiple fractures than those younger than 75 years (16.3 vs 4%, p = 0.01). Conclusion A quarter of patients presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture have an undiagnosed vertebral fracture. Older people are more likely to have vertebral fractures and more likely to have multiple fractures. VFA during bone densitometric assessment can further aid stratifying future fracture risk.

In this technique, a 36 pm laser line is projected on the metallic surface through a laser diode head, which is placed to a small distance away from the target. The micro laser line is captured by a CCD camera, which is attached to the microscope. The surface topography is computed by triangulation by means of the line position and microscope vision parameters. The calibration of the microscope vision system is carried out by an adaptive genetic algorithm based on the line position. In this algorithm, an objective function is constructed from the microscope geometry to determine the microscope vision parameters. Also, the genetic algorithm provides the search space to calculate the microscope vision parameters with high accuracy in fast form. This procedure avoids errors produced by the missing of references and physical measurements, which are employed by the traditional microscope vision systems. The contribution of the proposed system is corroborated by an evaluation via accuracy and speed of the traditional microscope vision systems, which retrieve micro-scale surface topography.

The renal chronic inflammatory reaction in the setting of diabetes is one of the important hallmarks of diabetic renal fibrosis. However, it remains unknown whether CK2 influences the process of diabetic renal fibrosis. The current study is aimed to investigate if CK2 alpha ameliorates renal inflammatory fibrosis in diabetes via NF-kappa B pathway. To explore potential regulatory mechanism of CK2 alpha, the expression and activity of CK2 alpha, which were studied by plasmid transfection, selective inhibitor, small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and adenovirus infection in vitro or in vivo, were analyzed by means of western blotting (WB), dual luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The following findings were observed: (1) Expression of CK2 alpha, was upregulated in kidneys of di:0:lb and KKAy diabetic mice; (2) Inhibition of CK2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of CK2 alpha protein expression suppressed high glucose-induced expressions of FN and ICAM-1 in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs); (3) Inhibition of CK2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of CK2 alpha protein expression not only restrained hcB degradation, but also suppressed HG-induced nuclear accumulation, transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B in GMCs; (4) Treatment of TBB or CK2 alpha RNAi adenovirus infection ameliorated renal fibrosis in diabetic animals; (5) Treatment of TBB or CK2 alpha RNAi adenovirus infection suppressed hcB degradation and NF-kappa B nuclear accumulation in glomeruli of diabetic animals.

1591,"A detailed discussion on genesis, determinant and algorithmic method of the harmonic distortion of Switched Capacitor integrator and Switched-Capacitor based second order Sigma-Delta modulator is presented. In many instances, people make harmonic distortion analysis of signal through expanding periodic signal into Fourier series or making Fourier transformation for non-periodic signal respectively. Actually, due to the complexity of transient response of Switched-Capacitor integrator, the output expression of second-order Sigma-Delta modulator loop filter is also not trivial, so we will be in great trouble if traditional method is employed when its harmonics are analyzed and calculated in such a way. A fact that is noteworthy is no matter how complicated the output response of the second integrator of the modulator is, its harmonic expression has the same functional form whether in the whole time domain or at the discrete time moments. From this we turn the harmonic analysis of the continuous-time transient response into another thing, namely computing the harmonic coefficients of the transient response at discrete time moments. The least square method is adopted in process of calculation. When developing the output expression of second-order Sigma-Delta modulator, the following point is clarified, that the harmonic distortion is dominated by the first Switched-Capacitor integrator, owing to the suppression resulted from the closed feedback of harmonic distortion of the second stage is much greater than the first stage. In addition, it is avoided that the harmonic distortion is once again brought into the feedback signal in calculation, through the way that first the additive harmonic error model is utilized to get the transfer function, second replaced by gain model in the form of power series. And by doing so, both the feasibility and simplicity of the analysis and mathematical derivation are enhanced effectively.

The hyperspectral images in the visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) region of 400-1100 nm were acquired for fifty pork samples, and their VIS/NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were extracted from the images. The reference values of TVC in pork samples were determined by classical microbiological plating method. Both partial least square regression (PLSR) model and support vector machine regression model (SVR) of TVC were built for comparative analysis to achieve better results. Different transformation methods and filtering methods were applied to improve the models. The results show that both the optimized PLSR model and SVR model can predict the TVC very well, while the SVR model based on second derivation was better, which achieved with R-P (correlation coefficient of prediction set) = 0.94 and SEP (standard error of prediction set) = 0.4570 log CFU/g in the prediction set. An image processing algorithm was then developed to transfer the prediction model to every pixel of the image of the entire sample; the visualizing map of TVC would be displayed in real-time during the detection process due to the simplicity of the model.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the pollution load of composite industrial effluents discharged from the State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) Integrated Industrial Estate (1E) at Haridwar (Uttarakhand), India with reference to ecological risks. Methodology: Due to large outstretch of industrial area, the industrial complex was divided into four clusters (Cluster A to Cluster D). The effluent samples were collected from the drainage channels marked from the sampling sites at industrial area. Standard methods of APHA (2012) were followed for the analysis of effluents samples. Results: The results revealed that there was a remarkably high pollution load at industrial estate. The effluents discharged from the industrial units at Cluster C were slightly acidic (pH 5.33) and the parameters like TDS (2107.67 mg l(-1)), BOD (453.33 mg l(-1)), COD (1003.3 mg l(-1)) and some heavy metals like Fe (37.38 mg l(-1)), Cr (11.254 mg l(-1)), Cu (4.9 mg l(-1)) and Pb (2.11 mg l(-1)) exceeded the permissible limits as prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS, 2012), thereby indicating a considerably higher load of pollutants. The load of metals concentration in the effluents of different clusters was found in the following order: Fe>Cd>Zn>Ni>Cr>Cu>Pb>Mn. The higher content of metals in industrial wastewater may be due to the discharge of untreated effluents from metal processing industries. Interpretation: Disposal of effluents can be a source of severe ecological risks in the form of contamination of groundwater, soil, vegetation. Consumption of crops and vegetables irrigated with these effluents may have serious threats to human health, thereby causing a risk of various ailments like encephalopathy, cardiovascular and kidney diseases; muscular pain and intestinal hemorrhage. It is recommended that pollution control and regulatory authorities should periodically monitor the quality of effluents so as to ensure the compliance of prescribed standards.

We then explored highly associated patterns of greater F-18-AV-1451 binding and increased annualized change in cortical amyloid-beta plaques measured as florbetapir positron emission tomography binding antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, and to what extent these multimodal pattern associations explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independently and jointly. We found that: (i) F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention was differentially associated with age, and cross-sectional florbetapir positron emission tomography retention, but not with years of education, gender, or APOE genotype; (ii) increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, in the parieto-temporal and precuneus brain regions was associated with greater F-18-AV-1451 PET retention most prominently in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the full cohort, with florbetapir positive/negative-associated variability; and (iii) this F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention pattern significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independent of the associated antecedent increased annualized change in florbetapir positron emission tomography retention. These findings are in agreement with the pathology literature, which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloid-beta plaques correlate with cognition and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, non-local associations linking increased amyloid-beta accumulation rates with increased tau deposition are of great interest and support the idea that the amyloid-beta pathology might have remote effects in disease pathology spread potentially via the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks.

1597,"A large quantity of recent research into the harvesting of electrical energy from ambient vibration sources has been focused on the improvement of device performance via the deliberate introduction of dynamic nonlinearities. In addition to this, the realisation that most of these kinetic energy sources are stochastic in nature has led to many studies focusing on the response of energy harvesters to random vibrations (often Gaussian white noise). This differs from early studies in which it was assumed that ambient vibration sources were sinusoidal. The aim of the present study is to take current nonlinear energy harvesting solutions and to numerically analyse their effectiveness when two real ambient vibration sources are used: human walking motion and the oscillation of the midspan of a suspension bridge. This study shows that the potential improvements that can be realised through the introduction of nonlinearities into energy harvesters are sensitive to the type of ambient excitation to which they are subjected. Additionally, the need for more research into the development of low-frequency energy harvesters is emphasised.

1598,"Acetyl Cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as Donepezil, Rivastigmine and Galantamine are approved by US-FDA as first line drugs to treat the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their beneficial effects are attributed to their ability to elevate endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) at the M-1 muscarinic receptor in the brain. However, their side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, loss of appetite and altered heart rate are related to non-specific activation of M-2-M-5 muscarinic subtypes in various tissues. It is logical, therefore, to develop agonists with M-1 receptor selectivity. Unfortunately, this is limited due to a high degree of orthosteric site homology among the receptor subtypes. In contrast, their allosteric sites are unique and, therefore, allow selective targeting using positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). PAMs of M-1 receptors are devoid of agonist activity, however, when bound they enhance the binding affinity of orthosteric ligand, ACh. The major limitation of these PAMs is their bioavailability in the brain. In the current hypothesis, we propose surface modified nano-lipid drug conjugates (LDC-NPs) of PAMs of M-1 receptors to improve their bioavailability in brain. When co-administered with AChE inhibitors they are expected to increase their efficacy and reduce their therapeutic dose and side effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Rats with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes and non-diabetic rats were subjected to 30min myocardial ischaemia and 2h reperfusion after being randomized to treatment with (1) saline, (2) RhoA/Rho-associated kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil, (3) nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-G-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate followed by hydroxyfasudil, (4) arginase inhibitor N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine, (5) N-G-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate followed by N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine or (6) N-G-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate given intravenous before ischaemia. Results: Myocardial arginase activity, arginase 2 expression and RhoA/Rho-associated kinase activity were increased in type 1 diabetes (p<0.05). RhoA/Rho-associated kinase inhibition and arginase inhibition significantly reduced infarct size in diabetic and non-diabetic rats (p<0.001). The cardioprotective effects of hydroxyfasudil and N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine in diabetes were abolished by nitric oxide synthase inhibition. RhoA/Rho-associated kinase inhibition attenuated myocardial arginase activity in diabetic rats via a nitric oxide synthase-dependent mechanism. Conclusion: Inhibition of either RhoA/Rho-associated kinase or arginase protects from ischaemia-reperfusion injury in rats with type 1 diabetes via a nitric oxide synthase-dependent pathway. These results suggest that inhibition of RhoA/Rho-associated kinase and arginase constitutes a potential therapeutic strategy to protect the diabetic heart against ischaemia-reperfusion injury.

3,"As muscle activity during growth is considerably important for mandible quality and morphology, reducing dietary loading directly influences the development and metabolic activity of mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC). However, an overall investigation of changes in the protein composition of MCC has not been fully described in literature. To study the protein expression and putative signaling in vivo, we evaluated the structural changes of MCC and differentially expressed proteins induced by reducing functional loading in rat MCC at developmental stages. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation-based 2D nano-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) technologies were used. Global protein profiling, KEGG and PANTHER pathways, and functional categories were analyzed. Consequently, histological and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining indicated the altered histological structure of condylar cartilage and increased bone remodeling activity in hard-diet group. A total of 805 differentially expressed proteins were then identified. GO analysis revealed a significant number of proteins involved in the metabolic process, cellular process, biological regulation, localization, developmental process, and response to stimulus. KEGG pathway analysis also suggested that these proteins participated in various signaling pathways, including calcium signaling pathway, gap junction, ErbB signaling pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Collagen types I and II were further validated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. Taken together, the present study provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of regulating condylar growth and remodeling induced by reducing dietary loading at the protein level.

4,"Background: Ethanol photosynthetic production based on cyanobacteria cell factories utilizing CO2 and solar energy provides an attractive solution for sustainable production of green fuels. However, the scaling up processes of cyanobacteria cell factories were usually threatened or even devastated by biocontaminations, which restricted biomass or products accumulations of cyanobacteria cells. Thus it is of great significance to develop reliable bio-contamination- controlling strategies for promoting ethanol photosynthetic production in large scales. Results: The scaling up process of a previously developed Synechocystis strain Syn-HZ24 for ethanol synthesis was severely inhibited and devastated by a specific contaminant, Pannonibacter phragmitetus, which overcame the growths of cyanobacteria cells and completely consumed the ethanol accumulation in the cultivation systems. Physiological analysis revealed that growths and ethanol-consuming activities of the contaminant were sensitive to alkaline conditions, while ethanol-synthesizing cyanobacteria strain Syn-HZ24 could tolerate alkaline pH conditions as high as 11.0, indicating that pH-increasing strategy might be a feasible approach for rescuing ethanol photosynthetic production in outdoor cultivation systems. Thus, we designed and evaluated a Bicarbonate-based Integrated Carbon Capture System (BICCS) derived pH-rising strategy to rescue the ethanol photosynthetic production in non-sterilized conditions. In lab scale artificially simulated systems, pH values of BG11 culture medium were maintained around 11.0 by 180 mM NaHCO3 and air steam, under which the infection of Pannonibacter phragmitetus was significantly restricted, recovering ethanol production of Syn-HZ24 by about 80%. As for outdoor cultivations, ethanol photosynthetic production of Syn-HZ24 was also successfully rescued by the BICCS-derived pH-rising strategy, obtaining a final ethanol concentration of 0.9 g/L after 10 days cultivation. Conclusions: In this work, a novel product-consuming biocontamination pattern in cyanobacteria cultivations, causing devastated ethanol photosynthetic production, was identified and characterized. Physiological analysis of the essential ethanol-consuming contaminant directed the design and application of a pH-rising strategy, which effectively and selectively controlled the contamination and rescued ethanol photosynthetic production. Our work demonstrated the importance of reliable contamination control systems and strategies for large scale outdoor cultivations of cyanobacteria, and provided an inspiring paradigm for targeting effective solutions.

5,"Aim: Increased afferent fibre activity contributes to pathological conditions such as the overactive bladder syndrome. Nerve fibres running near the urothelium are considered to be afferent as no efferent system has yet been described. The aim of this study was to identify sub-types of afferent nerve fibres in the mouse bladder wall based on morphological criteria and analyse regional differences. Materials and methods: 27 bladders of six month old C57BL/6 mice were removed and tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry. Cryostat sections were cut and stained for Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP), calcitonin gene related polypeptide (CGRP), neurofilament (NF), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Results: In the sub-urothelium, different types of afferent nerve fibre were found, i.e. immunoreactive (IR) to; CGRP, NF, VAChT, and/or nNOS. At the bladder base, the sub-urothelium was more densely innervated by CGRP-IR and VAChT-IR nerve fibres, then at the lateral wall. NF- and nNOS nerves were sparsely distributed in the sub-urothelium throughout the bladder. At the lateral wall the inner muscle is densely innervated by CGRP-IR nerve fibres. NF, VAChT and nNOS nerves were evenly distributed in the different muscle layers throughout the bladder. Nerve fibre terminals expressing CGRP and NF were found within the extra-mural ganglia at the bladder base. Conclusions: Different types of afferent nerve fibres were identified in the sub-urothelium of the mouse bladder. At the bladder base the sub-urothelium is more densely innervated than the lateral wall by CGRP-IR and VAChT-IR afferent nerve fibres. CGRP and NF afferent nerve fibres in the muscle layer probably relay afferent input to external ganglia located near the bladder base. The identification of different afferent nerves in the sub-urothelium suggests a functional heterogeneity of the afferent nerve fibres in the urinary bladder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

6,"As the prevalence of embedded systems in various fields has spread, real-time operating systems (RTOSs) have been widely used for many years satisfying real-time requirements and a multitasking design. The use of RTOS adds additional overhead to a system, which should be deliberately considered and evaluated in some critical systems. This paper presents a qualitative and quantitative comparison between an open-source RTOS (FreeRTOS V8.0.0) and a commercial one (mu C/OS-III). Both RTOS use a preemptive multitasking kernel, with additional support for round robin scheduling. We aim to benchmark and evaluate their performance and behaviour, including seven performance tests and two behaviour tests. Comparing the measurement results shows that the commercial mu C/OS-III does not behave much better than FreeRTOS. Furthermore, we discovered that the priority changing function of mu C/OSIII does not behave correctly in some circumstances. Although FreeRTOS has no such problem in the latest version, it still has a problem with its dynamic memory management.

Analyse and produce suitable mechanisms utilising smart materials to increase device functionality aiding successful patient intubation procedures. Methods This work describes the total design activity that contributes to the successful development of medical devices, from case of need, to smart material actuation mechanisms. Research focuses on identifying a suitable control mechanism to allow a steerable tip to be integrated into a bougie with a control device attached to the laryngoscope. Results Data collected from a user group survey supported the development of a novel bougie, with better shape retention, variable rigidity within the tip, and an integrated steerable function. Analysis of several mechanisms, artificial muscles, and smart materials identified a cost-effective steerable mechanism that can be incorporated into a bougie. Conclusion Users have defined a need for an improved bougie. Controlling smart materials and mechanisms, within the predefined dimensions, identified strengths and weaknesses associated with steerable functions. The performance of the selected mechanism for incorporation requires a high level of control to accurately steer a device within the human airway.

8,"As the first component of SPARC (Simulation Package for Ab-initio Real-space Calculations), we present an accurate and efficient finite-difference formulation and parallel implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for isolated clusters. Specifically, utilizing a local reformulation of the electrostatics, the Chebyshev polynomial filtered self-consistent field iteration, and a reformulation of the non-local component of the force, we develop a framework using the finite-difference representation that enables the efficient evaluation of energies and atomic forces to within the desired accuracies in DFT. Through selected examples consisting of a variety of elements, we demonstrate that SPARC obtains exponential convergence in energy and forces with domain size; systematic convergence in the energy and forces with mesh-size to reference plane-wave result at comparably high rates; forces that are consistent with the energy, both free from any noticeable 'egg-box' effect; and accurate ground-state properties including equilibrium geometries and vibrational spectra. In addition, for systems consisting up to thousands of electrons, SPARC displays weak and strong parallel scaling behavior that is similar to well-established and optimized plane-wave implementations, but with a significantly reduced prefactor. Overall, SPARC represents an attractive alternative to plane-wave codes for practical DFT simulations of isolated clusters.

9,"Background: Restricting access to lethal means is a well-established strategy for suicide prevention. However, the hypothesis of subsequent method substitution remains difficult to verify. In the case of jumping from high places ('hotspots'), most studies have been unable to control for a potential shift in suicide locations. This investigation aims to evaluate the short-and long-term effect of safety barriers on Brisbane's Gateway Bridge and to examine whether there was substitution of suicide location. Methods: Data on suicide by jumping - between 1990 and 2012, in Brisbane, Australia were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register. The effects of barrier installation at the Gateway Bridge were assessed through a natural experiment setting. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were used. Results: Of the 277 suicides by jumping in Brisbane that were identified, almost half (n = 126) occurred from the Gateway or Story Bridges. After the installation of barriers on the Gateway Bridge, in 1993, the number of suicides from this site dropped 53.0% in the period 1994-1997 (p = 0.041) and a further reduction was found in subsequent years. Analyses confirmed that there was no evidence of displacement to a neighbouring suicide hotspot (Story Bridge) or other locations. Conclusions: The safety barriers were effective in preventing suicide from the Gateway Bridge, and no evidence of substitution of location was found.

10,"Base stations equipped with resources to harvest renewable energy are not only environment-friendly but can also reduce the grid energy consumed, thus bringing cost savings for the cellular network operators. Intelligent management of the harvested energy can further increase the cost savings. Such management of energy savings has to be carefully coupled with managing the quality of service so as to ensure customer satisfaction. In such a process, there is a trade-off between the energy drawn from grid and the quality of service. Unlike prior studies which mainly focus on network energy minimization, this paper proposes a framework for jointly managing the grid energy savings and the quality of service (in terms of the network latency), which is achieved by downlink power control and user association reconfiguration. We use a real BS deployment scenario from London, U.K., to show the performance of our proposed framework and compare it against existing benchmarks. We show that the proposed framework can lead to around 60% grid energy savings as well as better network latency performance than the traditionally used scheme.

12,"Biocrusts are critical components of desert ecosystems, significantly modifying the surfaces they occupy. The mixture of biological components and soil particles that form the crust, in conjunction with moisture, determines the biocrusts' spectral signatures. Proximal and remote sensing in complemeritary spectral regions, namely the reflective region, and the thermal region, have been used to study biocrusts in a non-destructive manner, in the laboratory, in the field, and from space. The objectives of this review paper are to present the spectral characteristics of biocrusts across the optical domain, and to discuss significant developments in the application of proximal and remote sensing for biocrust studies in the last few years. The motivation for using proximal and remote sensing in biocrust studies is disttissed. Next, the application of reflectance spectroscopy to the study of biocrusts is presented followed by a review of the emergence of high spectral resolution thermal remote sensing, Which facilitates the application of thermal spectroscopy for biocrust studies. Four specific topics at the forefront of proximal and remote sensing of biocrusts are discussed: (1) The use of remote sensing in determining the role of biocrusts in global biogeochemical cycles; (2) Monitoring the inceptive establishment of biocrusts; (3) Identifying and characterizing biocrusts using Longwave infrared spectroscopy; and (4) Diurnal emissivity dynamics of biocrusts in a sand dune environment. The paper concludes by identifying innovative technologies such as low altitude and high resolution imagery that are increasingly used in remote sensing science, and are expected to be used in future biocrusts studies.

Traditional 3D modeling platforms such as Maya and ZBrush, utilize ""windows, icons, menus, pointers"" (WIMP) interface paradigms for fine-grained control to construct detailed models. However, the modeling progress can be tedious and frustrating and thus too hard for a novice user or even a well trained artist. Therefore, a more intuitive interface is needed. Sketch, an intuitive communication and modeling tool for human beings, becomes the first choice of modeling community. So far, various sketch-based modeling systems have been created and studied.

Serum thyroid hormone levels were determined using ELISA.Results: Our study showed higher TSH and FT4 levels and lower FT3 levels in women with preeclampsia compared to normal pregnant women, with statistical significance for women with mild and severe preeclampsia. The risk to develop pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), mild or severe preeclampsia was increased in carriers of at least one D2-Ala92 allele. TSH and FT4 levels were significantly higher and FT3 levels were significantly lower in preeclamptic women with severe preeclampsia if they carried the D2-Ala92 allele compared to non-carriers. Pregnant women with PIH and mild preeclampsia, carriers of at least one D2-Ala92 allele, delivered at lower gestational age neonates with a lower birth weight compared to non-carriers, but the results were statistically significant only in severe preeclampsia.Conclusion: The D2-Thr92Ala genetic variant is associated with the severity and the obstetric outcome of preeclampsia, and it also influences thyroid hormone levels. The study demonstrates non-thyroidal biochemical hypothyroidism - as a result of deiodination effects due to D2 genotypes.

15,"A system is described for determination of discrete pulse train characteristics of multi spot laser delivery systems for retinal photocoagulation. While photodiodes provide an ideal detection mechanism, measurement artifacts can potentially be introduced by the spatial pattern of the delivered beam relative to a discrete photodiode element. This problem was overcome by use of an integrating sphere to produce a uniform light field at the site of the photodiode detector. A basic current driven photodiode detection circuit incorporating an operational amplifier was used to generate a signal captured by a commercially available USB interface device at a rate of 10 kHz. Studies were undertaken of a Topcon Pascal Streamline laser system with output at a wavelength of 577 nm (yellow). This laser features the proprietary feature of 'Endpoint Management'(TM) where pulses can be delivered as 100% of set energy levels with visible reaction on the retina and also at a reduced energy level to create potentially non visible but clinically effective lesions. Using the pulse train measurement device it was identified that the 'Endpoint Management'(TM) delivery mode of pulses of lower energy was achieved by reducing the pulse duration of pulses for non-visible effect pulses while maintaining consistent beam power levels within the delivered pulse profile. The effect of eye geometry in determining safety and effectiveness of multi spot laser delivery for retinal photocoagulation is discussed. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

21,"Aim. This paper is a report of a study of factors that affect turnover of newly licensed registered nurses in United States hospitals. Background. There is a large body of research related to nursing retention; however, there is little information specific to newly licensed registered nurse turnover. Incidence rates of turnover among new nurses are unknown because most turnover data are not from nationally representative samples of nurses. Method. This study used a longitudinal panel design to obtain data from 1653 registered nurses who were recently licensed by examination for the first time. We mailed surveys to a nationally representative sample of hospital registered nurses 1 year apart. The analytic sample consisted of 1653 nurses who responded to both survey mailings in January of 2006 and 2007. Results. Full-time employment and more sprains and strains (including back injuries) result in more turnover. Higher intent to stay and hours of voluntary overtime and more than one job for pay reduces turnover. When we omitted intent to stay from the probit model, less job satisfaction and organizational commitment led to more turnover, confirming their importance to turnover. Magnet Recognition Award (R) hospitals and several other work attributes had no effect on turnover. Conclusion. Turnover problems are complex, which means that there is no one solution to decreasing turnover. Multiple points of intervention exist. One specific approach that may improve turnover rates is hospital policies that reduce strains and sprains.

It can achieve high quality of service (QoS) by reducing the packet dropping probability and network utilization. Three robust control algorithms are proposed in this paper in order to design robust AQM schemes: conventional H controller, robust particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based PID (proportional-integral-derivative) (PSOPID) controller, and robust ant-colony optimization (ACO)-based PID (ACOPID) controller. PSO and ACO methods are used to tune the PID controller parameters subject to H constraints to achieve the required robustness of the network. Robust PSOPID and ACOPID controllers can achieve desirable time-response specifications with a simple design procedure and low-order controller in comparison to the conventional H controller. Wide ranges of system parameters change are used to show the robustness of the designed controllers. The ability of the designed controllers to meet the specified performance is demonstrated using MATLAB 7. 11, (R2010b): The MathWorks, Inc.3 Apple Hill Drive Natick, MA USA. On the other hand, to verify the effectiveness of the designed controller, nonlinear simulation is performed using the NS2 package.

It is particularly noticeable in people involved in professional sports where sport-related injuries commonly occur and are associated with intense exercise which aims to improve physical fitness. The article attempts to determine incidence of sports injuries reported by Plus League volleyball players, as well as to identify their most common types and causes. Methods. The research project involved 90 Plus League volleyball players aged 18-37 with the average age of 25.11 (SD +/- 5.378). A method of diagnostic survey was applied to collect empirical data by means of questionnaire developed by the authors (researchers). The results were statistically analysed and verified with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi(2) test at the significance level (or critical P-value) of P <= 0.05 Results. Over 87% of the respondents suffered from at least one sport-related injury. In total, 362 injuries occurred, on average 4.02 injuries per one volleyball player. The most common sports injuries involved ankle or talocrural joint (46 injuries), knee and lower leg muscles (30), interphalangeal articulations of fingers (30) as well as shoulder joint. More than half of the injuries (57%) occurred twice or three times. Volleyball players commonly sustain injuries through contact with an opposing player in competition. Sport-specific injuries may also occur due to exhaustion, lack of rest and undertreated injuries. Conclusion. The most common volleyball-related injuries are primarily talocrural joint, hand and shoulder injuries. Common types of injuries that can affect volleyball players include muscles, joints and ligaments injuries, sprains and strains as well as bruises. Most of these injuries are caused by exhaustion, contact with an opposing player during competition and fatigue. The incidence of sport-related injuries seems to be influenced by such factors as somatic features, jumping parameters and the length of professional volleyball career.

24,"At present, China's grain production pattern runs counter to the distribution patterns of farmland resources and water-heat conditions. It is urgently important to conduct research on the spatial matching of grain production and farmland resources. Based on the Potential Crop Rotation data, with regards to the situations of irrigation and rain feeding, this paper builds a measuring model of potential farmland, and separately measures the spatial matching/index of grain yield with actual and potential farmland resources, thus revealing China's grain production pattern. The results indicate that serious spatial mismatch exists between grain production and farmland resources in China. Take the potential crop rotation system into consideration, the spatial mismatch of grain yield and potential farmland resources has been aggravated by the grain production barycenter's shift to the north China, with low Crop Rotation Index. The function-promoting regions of grain production in China are going through two evolution patterns of ""northward and southward expansion"" and ""westward movement and northward expansion,"" respectively. Inefficient use of farmland mainly occurs in the fragile ecological environments, such as the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China, the northwest area of Xinjiang and the southwest karst landform areas. The inefficient use of and the decreasing amount of available farmland have become the main causes of the decline in grain production. The problems facing Chinese agriculture caused by the spatial mismatch include the imbalance in regional structures, ecological risks, agricultural production risks, and the risk of food price. In order to cope with these problems, this paper provides some advices on protecting farmland acreage, expanding farmland potential, ensuring the safety of water resources, and extending the industrial grain chain. Our paper additionally proposes policy reforms and innovations designed to ensure the implementation of the above measures, so as to commonly defuse China's food security crisis.

Recent studies have suggested the association of IL-23R polymorphisms with bone and articular inflammation in diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to determine the association between IL-23R polymorphisms and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). MethodA case-control study on 55 patients with JIA and 78 healthy controls was performed. All samples were genotyped for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL23R (rs1004819, rs2201841, rs10889677, rs1495965, rs7517847, rs10489629, rs11209026 and rs1343151), using real-time polymerase chain reaction Taqman genotyping technique. Forty-two patients and 42 healthy controls were chosen randomly to measure the level of serum IL-17A using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsAlthough the heterozygous genotype of rs1004819 (GA) showed a weak, but statistically significant protective effect on polyarticular subtype (P=0.03), none of the selected SNPs were associated with JIA overall. Indeed the analysis of haplotypes did not show any significant association with JIA. Serum IL-17A level was not significantly different among patients and healthy controls and between JIA subtypes, as well. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between SNPs and serum IL-17A concentration. ConclusionThis is the first study of the IL-23R gene in Iranian patients with JIA. Our results did not show any strong association between IL-23R polymorphisms and JIA disease or serum IL-17A levels. The only association was seen between rs1004819 and polyarticular JIA. Further larger studies may help clarify the role, if any, of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of JIA.

PID controller parameters for a control system that behaves as closely as possible to the reference model for disturbance rejection are derived. Two algorithms are developed to calculate the PID parameters. One algorithm determines the optimal time delay in the reference model by solving an optimization problem, whereas the other algorithm avoids the nonlinear optimization by using a simple approximation for the time delay term, enabling derivation of analytical PID tuning formulas. Because plant data integrals are used in the regression equations for calculating PID parameters, the two proposed algorithms are robust against measurement noises. Moreover, the controller tuning involves an adjustable design parameter that enables the user to achieve a trade-off between performance and robustness. Because of its closed-loop tuning capability, the proposed method can be applied online to improve (retune) existing underperforming controllers for stable, integrating, and unstable plants. Simulation examples covering a wide variety of process dynamics, including two examples related to reactor systems, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tuning method.

28,"Aim: The role of uric acid as a risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases is controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between serum uric acid level and the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular events in middle-aged and non-obese Chinese men. Methods: We included 3152 participants from the health examination center of Tongji Hospital from June 2007 to June 2010. Clinical examination and medical records were collected at the annual health examination. The hazard ratios (HRs) of uric acid for cardio-cerebrovascular events were calculated by Cox proportional hazards models. Generalized additive model and threshold effect analysis were used to explore the non-linear relationship between serum uric acid level and the incidence of cardio-cerebrovascular event. Result: The mean follow-up time was 52 months. When the participants were classified into four groups by the serum acid quarter (Q1-Q4), the HRs (95% CI) of Q2-Q4 for cardio-cerebrovascular events were 1.26 (0.83, 1.92), 1.97 (1.33, 2.91) and 2.05 (1.40, 3.01), respectively, compared with the reference (Q1). The actual incidence and conditional incidence of cardio-cerebrovascular events in the high serum acid group were higher than those in the low serum acid group, which were stratified by the turning point (sUA = 372 mu mol/L). We also showed a strong prognostic accuracy of the multiple variable-based score in 3 years and 5 years, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.790 (0.756-0.823) and 0.777 (0.749-0.804), respectively. Conclusion: Serum uric acid level is a strong risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular events.

29,"As a result of rapid advances in technology and computer programming, algorithms are increasingly able to generate expressive material. In light of these advances, it is inevitable that courts will be asked to determine whether this algorithmically generated content is protected expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Although algorithmically generated content can serve many of the same constitutionally-protected purposes as human expression, this paper explains why the Supreme Court of Canada's current framework is inadequate for use in the context of algorithmically generated content. This paper offers a proactive and principled solution that is consistent with the fundamental principles of freedom of expression articulated by the Court in R v Keegstra. This solution allows content that upholds the Keegstra principles to be protected despite the fact that the algorithm's creator may not have contemplated the specific content.

30,"A study on the hydrodynamic modelling of pontoon bridges is presented, and exemplified with the Bergsoysund Bridge. The structural modelling is based on the finite element method using the FE-software ABAQUS; the fluid-structure interaction, as well as the wave action, are modelled applying linearized potential theory represented by the DNV HydroD WADAM software. The main emphasis is put on the stochastic response analysis within the framework of the power spectral density method. The accuracy of the presented modelling is outlined. Convergence of the response obtained by modal technique is dealt with. By means of state-space representation and an iteration algorithm, the quadratic eigenvalue problem is solved. Contribution from the fluid-structure interaction to the overall modal damping is presented and discussed, and is found to be significant. Critical damping ratios close to 11%, corresponding to modes with natural frequency around 1 rad/s, are found. The displacement response is considered near-converged when approximately 30 modes are included.

By conducting statistical analysis (Pearson correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and Mann-Whitney test), gross floor area, latitude, and longitude were influence factors which cause the differences in environmental impacts among buildings. The differences in environmental impacts by gross floor area can be considered by defining the functional unit as one square meter of floor area. The differences in environmental impacts by region can be considered after dividing 23 elementary school buildings according to latitude and longitude. Based on the results of the two-step cluster analysis and the Mann-Whitney test on latitude and longitude, the environmental impacts of 23 elementary school buildings were divided into two clusters, with the exception of human carcinogenic potential and human non-carcinogenic potential. Therefore, this study presented the benchmarks in two clusters. For instance, the benchmarks for global warming potential in Clusters One and Two were 3.70E+03 and 2.53E+03 kg-CO2 eq./m(2), respectively. The benchmark for the human carcinogenic potential was 8.63E-08 cases(can)/m(2).

The temporal and spatial variations of water pollutant concentrations in the Huaihe River Basin were investigated and analyzed to provide a scientific basis for water pollution control, water environment protection, and ecological restoration. The results indicated that the Yinghe River, Quanhe River, Honghe River, Guohe River, and Baohe River were the most seriously polluted rivers, followed by Hongze Lake, Luoma Lake, Yishuhe River, and Nansi Lake. BOD5, CODMn, and NH3-N were the major pollution indexes, for which the monitoring stations reported that more than 40 % of the water quality concentrations exceeded the class IV level. There were 21, 50, 36, and 21 monitoring stations that recorded significantly decreasing trends for BOD5, CODMn, NH3-N, and TP, respectively, and 39 monitoring stations showed a significantly increasing trend for DO. Moreover, the water quality concentrations had a certain concentricity and volatility according to boxplot analysis for the 20 monitoring stations. The majority of monitoring stations recorded a large fluctuation for the monitoring indexes in 2003 and 2004, which indicated that the water quality concentrations were unstable. According to the seasonal variations of the water quality concentrations in the mainstream of Huaihe River, the monthly variation trends of the BOD5, CODMn, DO, NH3-N, and TP concentrations were basically consistent among the seven monitoring stations. The BOD5, CODMn, NH3 -N, and TP concentrations were affected by the change of the stream discharge; changes in DO and NH3-N concentrations were influenced by the regional environmental temperature, and the DO and NH3-N concentrations decreased when the water temperature increased.

34,"As one of the variations in frequent pattern mining, erasable pattern mining discovers patterns with benefits lower than or equal to a user-specified threshold from a product database. Although traditional erasable pattern mining algorithms can perform their own mining operations on static mining environments, they are not suitable for dealing with dynamic data stream environments. In such dynamic data streams, algorithms have to process them immediately with only one database scan in order to consider characteristics of data stream mining. However, previous tree-based erasable pattern mining methods have difficulty in processing dynamic data streams because they need two or more database scans to construct their own tree structures. In addition, they do not also consider specific information of each item within a product database, but they need to conduct mining operations considering such additional information of the items in order to find more useful erasable pattern results. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a weighted erasable pattern mining algorithm suitable for sliding window-based data stream environments. The algorithm employs tree and list data structures for more efficient mining processes and solves the problems of previous erasable pattern mining approaches by using a sliding window-based stream processing technique and an item weight-based pattern pruning method. We compare performance of the proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art tree-based approaches with respect to various real and synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our method is more efficient and scalable than the competitors in terms of runtime, memory, and pattern generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

35,"Availability of safe drinking water is considered a key challenge in the coastal region of Bangladesh. High concentrations of salinity, iron and arsenic, and the unavailability of suitable aquifers, have deterred the exploitation of groundwater resources. In addition the cyclonic storm surge is a major threat to this system. Cyclones accompanied by storm surges in the coastal area cause significant deterioration of drinking water supply and sanitation. Water professionals have launched some initiatives to promote small-scale, alternative safe water sources (e. g. rainwater harvesting, pond sand filters and piped water techniques) to provide sustainable solutions to the problem. However, a systematic evaluation of the alternatives that considers social, technical and economic criteria has not been carried out so far. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the alternative options for drinking water supply in a cyclone-prone area. The authors conducted a multi-criteria analysis and reached the conclusion that rainwater harvesting is the most suitable option for the area. Moreover, the final result was shared with the users to obtain their feedback to ensure sustainability of the water source.

The aspect ratio effects on the empirical formulae used to predict the static lift due to a stabilized Leading Edge Vortex (LEV) are provided. The unsteady lift due to arbitrary wing motion is generated using the static lift curve. Then, state-space representation for the unsteady lift is derived. The proposed model is validated through a comparison with direct numerical simulations of Navier-Stokes on hovering insects. A comparison with quasi-steady models that capture the LEV contribution is also performed to assess the role of unsteadiness. Similarly, a comparison with classical unsteady approaches is presented to assess the LEV dominance.

37,"A systematic non-probabilistic reliability analysis procedure for structural vibration active control system with unknown-but-bounded parameters is proposed. The state-space representation of active vibration control system with uncertain parameters is presented. Compared with the robust control theory, which is always over-conservative, the reliability-based analysis method is more suitable to deal with uncertain problem. Stability is the core of the closed-loop feedback control system design, so stability criterion is adopted to act as the limited state function for reliability analysis. The uncertain parameters without enough samples are modeled as interval variables. Interval perturbation method is employed to estimate the interval bounds of eigenvalues, which can be used to characterize the stability of the closed-loop active control system. Formulation of defining the reliability of active control system based on stability is discussed. A novel non-probabilistic reliability measurement index is discussed and used to determine the probability of the stability based on the area ratio.

38,"Background: Supraspinatus tears are common in pitchers. However, the effect of these tears on glenohumeral (GH) mechanics is incompletely understood. Purpose/Hypothesis: To describe the effect of supraspinatus tears and repairs on GH kinematics during an abbreviated throwing motion using the intact shoulder girdle. The hypothesis was that supraspinatus tears would lead to an increase of GH translation in the coronal plane and supraspinatus repairs would restore GH kinematics. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Six shoulders from 3 fresh-frozen cadavers were tested in a novel 7 degrees of freedom robotic testing system. Torsos were mounted and the wrist was pinned to an actuator mounted on an upper frame. After the deltoid was removed, the shoulders were studied during an abbreviated throwing motion (ATM) from maximum external rotation to the midcoronal plane to establish a baseline. The ATM was repeated after creation of a 1-cm supraspinatus tear, after creation of a 3-cm supraspinatus tear, and after repair with a transosseous equivalent (TOE) technique. Retroreflective bone markers and high-speed infrared cameras were used to measure GH kinematics and calculate the center of rotation of the GH joint (CORGH) instantaneously. Results: The 1- and 3-cm supraspinatus tears did not significantly alter GH translation. The TOE repair shifted the CORGH posteriorly, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the overall GH translation in all 3 planes (P = .003, .019, and .026, for x-y, y-z, and x-z planes, respectively). Conclusion: In contrast to a TOE repair of the supraspinatus tendon, isolated supraspinatus tears did not perturb GH kinematics in this cadaveric model of the throwing shoulder. Clinical Relevance: In throwing athletes, treatment of rotator cuff tears should be addressed with caution to avoid an unintended alteration in GH kinematics due to overtightening of the tendon.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the PARTNERS HF criteria to detect initial decompensation in a population of moderate heart failure patients under remote monitoring. Methods: We retrospectively applied the PARTNERS HF criteria to 1860 transmissions from 104 patients (median follow up 21 months; range 1-67 months), who were enrolled in our programme of telemedicine after cardiac resynchronisation therapy. We tested the ability of a score based on these criteria to predict any acute clinical decompensation occurring in the 15 days following a transmission. Results: In 441 cases, acute heart failure was diagnosed after the index transmission. The area under the curve (AUC) of the score for the diagnosis of acute decompensation was 0.752 (confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.728-0.777). The best score cut-off was consistent with the results of PARTNERS HF: with a score >= 2, sensitivity was 75% and specificity 68%. The odds ratio for events was 6.24 (CI 95% 4.90-7.95; p<0.001). Conclusions: When retrospectively applied to remote monitoring transmissions and arranged in a score, PARTNERS HF criteria could identify HF patients who subsequently developed acute decompensation. These results warrant prospective studies applying PARTNERS HF criteria to remote monitoring.

45,"Articular bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is mediated by the interaction between inflammation and pathways regulating bone metabolism. Inflammation promotes osteoclastogenesis and also inhibits osteoblast function, further contributing to the persistence of erosions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of skeletal remodeling and play a role in RA pathogenesis. We therefore determined the expression of miRNAs in inflamed synovial tissue and the role they play in pathways regulating osteoblast and osteoclast function. Using the serum transfer mouse model of RA in C57BL/6 mice, we performed Fluidigm high-throughput qPCR-based screening of miRNAs from nonarthritic and arthritic mice. Global gene expression profiling was also performed on Affymetrix microarrays from these same synovial samples. miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were subjected to comparative bioinformatics. A total of 536 upregulated genes and 417 downregulated genes were identified that are predicted targets of miRNAs with reciprocal expression changes. Gene ontology analysis of these genes revealed significant enrichment in skeletal pathways. Of the 22 miRNAs whose expression was most significantly changed (p < 0.01) between nonarthritic and arthritic mice, we identified their targets that both inhibit and promote bone formation. These miRNAs are predicted to target Wnt and BMP signaling pathway components. We validated miRNA array findings and demonstrated that secretion of miR-221-3p in exosomes was upregulated by synovial fibroblasts treated with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. Overexpression of miR-221-3p suppressed calvarial osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro. These results suggest that miRNAs derived from inflamed synovial tissues may regulate signaling pathways at erosion sites that affect bone loss and potentially also compensatory bone formation.

47,"As mobile social networks (MSNs) are booming and gaining tremendous popularity, there have been an increasing number of communications and interactions among users. Taking this advantage, users in MSNs make decisions via collecting and combining trust information from different users. Hence, trust evaluation technology has become a key requirement for network security in MSNs. In such MSNs, however, the community/group structures are dynamically changing, and users may belong to multiple communities/groups. Therefore, trust evaluation plays a critical role in inferring trustworthy contacts among users. In this paper, an innovative trust inference model is proposed for MSNs, in which multiple dimensional trust metrics are incorporated to reflect the complexity of trust. To infer trust relations between users in MSNs with complex communities, we first construct dynamic implicit social behavioral graphs (DynISBG) based on dynamic complex community/group structures and propose an efficient detection algorithm for DynISBG under fuzzy degree kappa. We then present a multi-dimensional fuzzy trust inferring approach that involves four metrics, that is, static attribute trust factor, dynamic behavioral trust factor, long-term trust evolution factor, and recommendation-based trust opinion. Moreover, to obtain the recommendation-based trust opinion about indirect connected users, we discuss the trust aggregation and propagation along trust path. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our novel approach with simulations.

48,"Background: The actual connectivity between populations of freshwater organisms is largely determined by species biology, but is also influenced by many area-and site-specific factors, such as water pollution and habitat fragmentation. Therefore, the prediction of effective gene flow, even for well-studied organisms, is difficult. The amphipod crustacean Gammarus fossarum is a key invertebrate in freshwater ecosystems and contains many cryptic species. One of these species is the broadly distributed G. fossarum clade 11 (type B). In this study, we tested for factors driving the genetic structure of G. fossarum clade 11 in a human-impacted landscape at local and regional scales. To determine population structure, we analyzed the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene of 2,086 specimens from 54 sampling sites and microsatellite loci of 420 of these specimens from ten sites. Results: We detected strong overall genetic differentiation between populations at regional and local scales with both independent marker systems, often even within few kilometers. Interestingly, we observed only a weak correlation of genetic distances with geographic distances or catchment boundaries. Testing for factors explaining the observed population structure revealed, that it was mostly the colonization history, which has influenced the structure rather than any of the chosen environmental factors. Whereas the number of in-stream barriers did not explain population differentiation, the few large water reservoirs in the catchment likely act as dispersal barriers. Conclusions: We showed that populations of Gammarus fossarum clade 11 are strongly isolated even at local scales in the human-impacted region. The observed genetic structure was best explained by the effects of random genetic drift acting independently on isolated populations after historical colonization events. Genetic drift in isolated populations was probably further enhanced by anthropogenic impacts, as G. fossarum is sensitive to many anthropogenic stressors. These findings highlight the importance of small-scale genetic studies to determine barriers restricting gene flow to prevent further loss of genetic diversity and maintain intact freshwater ecosystems.

49,"As an important pre-filtering procedure for object detection, objectness estimation now draws lots of attentions from both the video analysis and computer vision communities. Among the existing approaches, BING [1] (binarized normed gradients) is the recently proposed one that possesses the advantages of high object detection rate, ultra fast computational speed (i.e. 300 fps), small number of proposals, and good generalization ability. However, within BING's framework, only the uniform hierarchical ranking structure and gradient information are employed for objectness characterization, which leads to high false positive rate. To address this issue, an effective and efficient cascade ranking method is proposed to refine BING, in this paper. It declares three main contributions. First, the concept of scale-sets histogram is novelly introduced. It helps to analyze the potential sizes of the objects. Secondly, more descriptive visual features (i.e. the color-texture consistence) are considered simultaneously for objectness characterization. Lastly, we propose hierarchical sorting to further leverage the ranking performance, according to the local contrast analysis between the inside and straddling superpixels of the object proposal windows. The experimental results on four challenging datasets PASCAL VOC2007, PASCAL VOC2010, PASCAL VOC2012 and ILSVRC2014 demonstrate that, the refined BING can achieve good balance between high detection rate (DR) (e.g. 96.7% DR with 1000 proposal windows on VOC2007), and low time consumption (e.g. 75 ms per image on VOC2007). It is also worth noting that, with a relatively small number of proposals (e.g. fewer than 200 proposals), our approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the detection rate, on all the testing datasets.

The modeling strategy is based on a combination of two sub-models: a global thermal model of the engine to deal with heat sources coupling and a detailed equivalent electrical network model which accounts for the gas and mechanical dynamic physics of the engine. Derived features, such as the amplitude, the frequency, the compression and the expansion powers are then finally obtained. The model is experimentally validated with a prototype of a free piston Stirling engine. Mean error on the amplitude, the frequency, the internal temperatures and the compression and expansion powers is 9%, so the model is considered accurate enough to predict performances. For optimization purpose, a numerical analysis is performed selecting the three following critical parameters: (i) dead volume of the chambers, (ii) natural frequency of the mechanical oscillators and (iii) thermal conduction between hot and cold sides. Smaller dead volume, large oscillating mass and high insulation are to be sought for maximizing the performances. With a pressurization of 3 bar, a theoretical useful power of 18 W can be reach with conservative modification of the existing prototype.

56,"Ac contactor is a kind of low voltage electrical appliances with large usage and wide application. Because of the frequent operation, contactor life must be long enough to ensure the reliable operation of power system. The electrical life of the contactor, as the key to affect the service life of the contactor, is mainly affected by the arc developed in the breaking and closing course. This paper concentrates on a new type of asynchronous modular contactor. To get the contactor movement characteristics, the dynamic model of the electromagnetic system is established by MATLAB/SIMULINK. Then, according to the displacement curve of contactor, the breaking process and closing process is planned. The thought of closed loop control, by adjusting the parameters of PID controller, enables the contactor to operate as the planning displacement curve. In addition, to achieve no arc or micro arc breaking and no bounce or micro bounce closing, a displacement closed loop control system for contactor is designed.

59,"Background: Persistent organic pollutants represent about 95 % of the industrial sector effluents in Egypt. Contamination of the River Nile water with various pesticides poses a hazardous risk to both human and environmental compartments. Therefore, a large scale monitoring study was carried on pesticides pollution in three geographical main regions along the River Nil water stream, Egypt. Methods: Organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed by GC-ECD. Results: Organochlorine pesticides mean concentrations along the River Nile water samples were 0.403, 1.081, 1.209, 3.22, and 1.192 mu g L-1 for endrin, dieldrin, p, p'-DDD, p, p'-DDT, and p, p'-DDE, respectively. Dieldrin, p, p'-DDT, and p, p'-DDE were above the standard guidelines of the World Health Organization. Detected organophosphorus pesticides were Triazophos (2.601 mu g L-1), Quinalphos (1.91 mu g L-1), fenitrothion (1.222 mu g L-1), Ethoprophos (1.076 mu g L-1), chlorpyrifos (0.578 mu g L-1), ethion (0.263 mu g L-1), Fenamiphos (0.111 mu g L-1), and pirimiphos-methyl (0.04 mu g L-1). Toxicity characterization of organophosphorus pesticides according to water quality guidelines indicated the hazardous risk of detected chemicals to the public and to the different environmental compartments. The spatial distribution patterns of detected pesticides reflected the reverse relationship between regional temperature and organochlorine pesticides distribution. However, organophosphorus was distributed according to the local inputs of pollutant compounds. Conclusions: Toxicological and water quality standards data revealed the hazardous risk of detected pesticides in the Egyptian River Nile water to human and aquatic life. Thus, our monitoring data will provide viewpoints by which stricter legislation and regulatory controls can be admitted to avoid River Nile pesticide water pollution.

60,"According to the EU statistics1 skin cancer - melanoma is the one of most deadly cancers. At the same time, it has up to 95% chance2 for curing if detected on the early stage. The early diagnostics is obstructed by low availability of dermatology specialists and low percentage of patients that are taking regular diagnostics. To deal with the early diagnostics unavailability we propose implementing portable automated diagnostic device, available to wide range of medical institutions. Automated diagnostic systems are not yet capable for providing final diagnosis, but are enough for detecting threats of skin cancer. Therefore, by bringing automatic tools to primary care physicians and other medical personal a lot persons could save their lives by detecting cancer on the early stage. To provide automated diagnostic tool, it is needed to solve multiple tasks including: skin images acquisition, image processing, calculating disease probability and delivering diagnosis result. These tasks have existing solutions as a commercial tool or as scientific methods, but there is a lack of ready to use service.

61,"At least since 1980, there has been a practically continuous, but somewhat fragmented discussion on the relevance of management research. This discussion has addressed practically all fields of management; here, besides general management, operations management, project management and construction management are examined in more detail. Although many different proposals have been made to rectify the situation, no definitive resolution has been found. In this paper, it is argued that prior analyses have not reached the root causes of the irrelevance problem. By an analysis of the recent history of management research, the following novel findings are reached. First, the root cause of the irrelevance is argued to lie in the 1959 reports on American business education, written by Pierson and Gordon & Howell. Second, while the proposed direction in the 1959 reports was deficient in several ways, the rejection of production as an integral part of organizations and management has been perhaps the most damaging feature of those reports. Third, current research on management suffers from a variety of immediate causes for irrelevance, insufficiently recognized by the scholarly community. It is suggested that reaching the root causes for irrelevance will facilitate finding suitable cures.

63,"A tracking controller is proposed for a crane attached to a mobile harbor (MH) equipped with a dual-stage trolley system, to dynamically position a container from the MH to the container ship or vice versa. Wave-induced motions of the MH and container ship occur during loading and unloading operations owing to external disturbances such as waves. However, a challenging task is to move a payload with unwanted swing motions accurately to the loading and unloading positions on a moving target vessel. To solve this problem, a dynamic MH crane model is derived in three-dimensional space, with roll, pitch, and heave motions caused by sea-wave disturbances. The MH crane model is then linearized to design a tracking controller and the parameters of the linearized model are obtained by carrying out the system identification process. A preview tracking control method that includes feedback and feed-forward control with the predicted target position in the x-y plane in the near future is utilized. Through numerical simulations and experiments with a scaled model, the tracking performance of the proposed dynamic positioning control system is considered when sinusoidal roll and pitch motions of the MH are generated to mimic the wavy sea environment.

METHODS: A retrospective study on cases of infective keratitis, attended our institution from Mar. 2013 to Feb. 2015, was done at Mansoura Ophthalmic Center, Egypt. Corneal scrapings were performed and processed for. direct microscopy and culture in appropriate media using standard laboratory protocols. RESULTS: Out of 245 patients enrolled for study, 247 corneal scrapings were obtained. Ocular trauma was the most common predisposing factor (51.4%), followed by diabetes mellitus (15.1%). Cultures were positive in 110 scraping samples (44.5%): 45.5% samples had pure fungal infection, 40% had pure bacterial infections and 10% had mixed fungal and bacterial growths. Acanthamoeba was detected in 5 (4.5%) samples. The most common fungal pathogen was Aspergillus spp. (41%). The most common bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (38.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.8%). CONCLUSION: Incidence of fungal keratitis is high in our region.

65,"AIM To study the association between vitamin D level and hospitalization rate in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS We designed a retrospective cohort study using adult patients (>19 years) with CD followed for at least one year at our inflammatory bowel disease center. Vitamin D levels were divided into: low mean vitamin D level (< 30 ng/mL) vs appropriate mean vitamin D level (30-100 ng/mL). Generalized Poisson Regression Models (GPR) for Rate Data were used to estimate partially adjusted and fully adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of hospitalization among CD patients. We also examined IRRs for vitamin D level as a continuous variable. RESULTS Of the 880 CD patients, 196 patients with vitamin D level during the observation period were included. Partially adjusted model demonstrated that CD patients with a low mean vitamin D level were almost twice more likely to be admitted (IRR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.38-2.24) compared to those with an appropriate vitamin D level. The fully adjusted model confirmed this association (IRR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.11-1.87). Partially adjusted model with vitamin D level as a continuous variable demonstrated, higher mean vitamin D level was associated with a 3% lower likelihood of admission with every unit (ng/mL) rise in mean vitamin D level (IRR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96-0.98). The fully adjusted model confirmed this association (IRR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99). CONCLUSION Normal or adequate vitamin D stores may be protective in the clinical course of CD. However, this role needs to be further characterized and understood.

66,"As solar energy costs continue to drop, the number of large-scale deployment projects increases, and the need for different analysis models for photovoltaic (PV) modules in both academia and industry rises. This paper proposes a modified equivalent-circuit model for PV modules. A PV module comprises several series-connected PV cells, to generate more electrical power, where each PV cell has an internal shunt resistance. Our proposed model simplifies the standard one-diode equivalent-circuit (SEC) model by removing the shunt resistance and including its effect on the diode part of the circuit, while retaining the original model accuracy. Our proposed equivalent circuit, called here a modified SEC (MSEC), has less number of circuit elements. All of the PV cells are assumed operating under the same ambient conditions where they share the same electric voltage and current values. To ensure the simplification did not come at a reduction in the accuracy of the SEC model, we validate our MSEC model by simulating both under the same conditions, calculate, and compare their current/voltage (I/V) characteristics. Our results validate the accuracy of our model with the difference between the two models falling below 1%. Therefore, the proposed model can be adopted as an alternative representation of the equivalent circuit for PV cells and modules.

67,"Aim. The authors proposed to retrospectively assess the incidence of ankle sprain and the relevant risk factors in footballers playing in the teams of the province of Parma during a professional season. Methods. Sixty-six football clubs from the province of Parma associated with the Italian Football Federation were contacted. Each athlete involved filled out a questionnaire. Results. Fifty-three athletes out of 1452 had suffered a case of ankle sprain during the professional season; 3.76% of these were amateurs, 2.1% were semi-professionals, and 18.2% were professionals. It was highlighted that in the majority of cases the ankle sprain was caused by contact during the game and that there were significant relations between the distortion and the period of the year, the number of weekly training sessions, the type of footwear worn, the characteristics of the pitch and the presence of past traumas. Discussion. The level of sports activity appears to be an important factor in injury-related risks, the resumption of the professional activity between August and October is related to a higher incidence of traumatisms. A more intense training session seems to protect from traumas, while the incidence of sprain does not appear to be related to the role of the player. Conclusion. There are different causes of ankle sprain in footballers. To reduce the incidence of these traumas it is advisable to apply adequate preventive measures on the basis of the most frequent risk factors.

68,"Automated compliance checking (ACC) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (BIMs). However, current industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs provide limited support for ACC, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (CC). In this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the IFC schema to incorporate CC-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. The method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to CC (e. g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the IFC class hierarchy. The proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from CC-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related IFC concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related IFC concepts. The proposed method enables the extension of the IFC schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. To test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the International Building Code (IBC) 2006 and 2009. Chapter 12 of IBC 2006 was used for training/development and Chapter 19 of IBC 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. Comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7% F1-measure, 84.5% adoption rate, and 87.9% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, IFC concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively.

The control group was subcutaneously injected with oil emulsion adjuvant and all other groups were subcutaneously immunized with an emulsified mixture of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 3555 peptide to induce EAON. Mice in the gypenosides groups were administered injections daily with three concentrations (15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg) of gypenosides respectively. Mice in the methylprednisolone group and the combination treatment group were injected daily with methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) or methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) + gypenosides (30 mg/kg), respectively. After MOG immunization, visual evoked potential (VEP), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and histopathologic examination were performed at 14, 20, 30, and 40d post-inoculation (p.i.).All results were expressed as mean +/- SEM. The data were evaluated by oneway ANOVA followed by Tukey or Games-Howell test. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, p2 latency was prolonged in the model group (P=0.041). Combination treatment can alleviated the change in VEP at 20d p.i. (P=0.012). Average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was reduced in the model group (P= 0.000, 30d; P=0.000, 40d) and gypenosides treatment remarkably diminished the degree of RNFL degeneration at 30d and 40d p.i (P=0.000, 30d; P=0.000, 40d). The pathomorphological results showed a decrease in demyelination (P=0.020) and inflammatory reactions in the combination group compared with the model group (20d p.i.). Gypenosides treatment also alleviated the degree of axonal loss (40d p.i.) (P=0.003). CONCLUSION: Treatment with gypenosides exerts protective effects on retinal nerve fibers and axons in EAON. When combined with gypenosides, methylprednisolone reduces demyelination in the acute stage of EAON.

70,"A transient response model for vapor compression refrigeration system has been developed in the paper. The system model contains four sub-models representing condenser, evaporator, compressor and electronic expansion valve (EEV). The condenser and the evaporator are developed based on the moving-boundary formulation. Through linearization, these dynamic models are transformed into state-space representation which is expressed in the form of matrix. The compressor and EEV adopt steady models because their thermal inertia is much smaller compared with the heat exchangers (i.e., condenser and the evaporator). The system model has been validated by experiment in terms of step change of EEV opening degree and heat load as well as ramp increase of inlet temperature of coolant oil of condenser. The results show that the model simulations have a good agreement with the experimental data. The simulation errors compared with the experimental data are mostly less than 10%. Since the model proposed in this study is expressed in the form of state-space matrix, they are featured by strong portability and high computation efficiency. It allows us to investigate the thermal dynamic characteristics of a refrigeration system under any complicated conditions and develop excellent control schemes.

The present study aimed to explore the protective factors against cognitive decline among community-dwelling middle-aged and older people from health, social, and lifestyle perspectives. MethodsData of the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study, a population-based cohort study in Taiwan, were retrieved for the study. Overall, 676 participants with intact baseline cognitive function (measured by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) were enrolled and followed for six years. Any increasing score of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire in the observational period was referred to as cognitive function decline. Associated factors for cognitive decline were identified by the logistic regression model. ResultsAmong all participants, 205 (30%) experienced cognitive decline during the study period. Crude logistic regression showed that women (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.6), low educational level (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-3.0) and low mastery (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9) were associated with cognitive decline, but no daily consumption of vegetables and fruits had only a marginal association (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.8). In the fully adjusted logistic regression analysis, old age, women, low educational level and low sense of mastery were independent predictors for cognitive decline. Participants with two modifiable factors (mastery, and daily consumptions of vegetables and fruits) had a lower risk of cognitive decline (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9), compared with those without any protective factor. ConclusionsParticipants with a better educational level, better personal mastery, and more consumption of fruits and vegetables were less likely to experience cognitive decline.

73,"A systematic method is proposed to approach complete fault coverage for catastrophic faults in analog circuits. In the proposed method, a fault propagation graph is first created from the circuit netlist. Standard graph theory techniques are then employed to identify a minimal set of observation points (MOP) such that, by monitoring these points, complete fault coverage can be achieved, i.e., all potential catastrophic faults of the circuit can be detected theoretically. The developed method is valuable because of the increasingly critical quality requirements for modern IC applications and the lack of existing methods that can achieve sub-ppm test escapes in the state-of-the-art. A widely used benchmark circuit, a CMOS operational amplifier, is utilized to demonstrate and validate the method. Simulation results show that all catastrophic faults can be detected by monitoring the identified MOP.

74,"Aim: It has been hypothesised that in atopic dermatitis, the dysfunctional skin barrier facilitates the transcutaneous presentation of allergens to the immune system. This study examined whether atopic dermatitis increased the likelihood of polysensitisation, namely sensitisation to five or more allergens. Methods: We examined the electronic hospital charts of 1743 children aged 0-17 years who had visited primary or secondary care physicians with allergic symptoms, whose blood was examined for the presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the 10 most common inhaled and food allergens and whose files contained documentation of the presence of atopic dermatitis and other skin disorders. Sensitisation was defined as a specific IgE level of >= 0.35 kU/L. Results: Polysensitisation was more common in children with atopic dermatitis (268/1197, 22.4%) than those without (30/546, 5.5%, p < 0.001). This remained significant after adjustment for gender and age in a multiple logistic regression model (odds ratio: 5.63, 95% confidence interval 3.77-8.40). Other skin disorders did not show an increased risk of polysensitisation (5/97, 5.2%). Conclusion: Polysensitisation was considerably more common in children with atopic dermatitis than those without. This supports the hypothesis that sensitisation occurs through a defective skin barrier and appears to be specific for atopic dermatitis.

Methods: A total of 136 patients with schizophrenia were evaluated for depression, cognitive insight and socio-occupational functioning. Results: Of the 136 patients included in the study, one-fourth (N=34; 25%) were found to have depression as per the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The prevalence of depression as assessed by Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and Depressive Subscale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-D) was 23.5%, 19.9% and 91.9%, respectively. Among the different scales, CDSS has highest concordance with clinician's diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for CDSS was also higher than that noted for HDRS and PANSS-D. When those with and without depression as per clinician's diagnosis were compared, those with depression were found to have significantly higher scores on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive and general psychopathology subscales, PANSS total score, participation restriction as assessed by P-scale and had lower level of functioning as assessed by Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). No significant difference was noted on negative symptom subscale of PANSS, clinical insight as assessed on G-12 item of PANSS, disability as assessed by Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS) and socio-occupational functioning as assessed by Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFS). In terms of cognitive insight, those with depression had significantly higher score for both the subscales, that is, self-reflective and self-certainty subscales as well as the mean composite index score. Conclusion: Our results suggest that one-fourth of patients with schizophrenia have depression, compared to HDRS and PANSS-D, CDSS has highest concordance with clinician's diagnosis of depression and presence of depression is related to cognitive insight.

76,"Biogas could provide a more sustainable energy source than wood fuels for rural households in sub-Saharan African. However, functioning of biogas digesters can be limited in areas of low water availability. The water required is approximately 50dm(3)day(-1) for each cow and 10dm(3)day(-1) for each pig providing manure to the digester, or 25 (+/- 6)dm(3)day(-1) for each person in the household, using a digester volume of 1.3 (+/- 0.3)m(3) capita(-1). Here, we consider the potential of domestic water recycling, rainwater harvesting, and aquaculture to supply the water needed for digestion in different countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Domestic water recycling was found to be important in every country but was usually insufficient to meet the requirements of the digester, with households in 72% of countries need to collect additional water. Rooftop rainwater harvesting also has an important role, iron roofs being more effective than thatched roofs at collecting water. However, even with an iron roof, the size of roof commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa (15 to 40m(2)) is too small to collect sufficient water, requiring an extra area (in m(2)) for each person of (R/100) (where R is the rainfall in mm). If there is a local market for fish, stocking a pond with tilapia, fed on plankton growing on bioslurry from the digester, could provide an important source of additional income and hold the water required by the digester. In areas where rainfall is low and seasonal, the fishpond might be stocked only in the rainy season, allowing the pond to be covered during the dry period to reduce evaporation. If evaporative losses (E in mm) exceed rainfall, an extra catchment area is needed to maintain the water level in the pond, equivalent to approximately (1.5x((E-R)/R))m(2) for each person in the household.

78,"As video games are continuously growing in popularity and number of users, the academic community has shown an increasing interest in their potential as innovative teaching tools. Typical games contain tasks that players must complete repetitively in order to advance to later levels, yet somehow they manage to keep them constantly motivated. Enjoyable engagement is achieved by using a number of interlocking techniques; these effectively hide repetitive or complex tasks by presenting them as a series of smaller challenges embedded in a reward system. Learning occurs through the use of a seamless combination of motor and high level problem solving skills with rapid feedback. Individual problem resolution cycles range from split second decisions to hours, if not days. Matching reward systems are used to maintain player interest throughout these cycles by ensuring that there is always a new reward just out of reach, yet still obtainable with relatively minor additional effort. As a result, players are propelled through the entire experience at a pace matched to their abilities. Based on these well-tested methods from the gaming industry, educators are trying to instil the motivational power of video games to the learning process by following a practice known as ""gamification"". When used in education, gamification incorporates gaming elements to non-game processes in order to aid learning and information retention. However, its application in the classroom has been challenging, since most attempts have generally been limited to implementing points, achievement badges and leader boards to existing course material. These rewards can potentially undermine the intrinsic sense of satisfaction that engaging in creative and productive work can generate. However, when used well, game elements can reinforce intrinsic satisfaction and rewards instead of replacing them. This quasi-experimental study employed a classroom version of the TV game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (R)"" to improve the delivery of an undergraduate programming course. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, empirical data on student satisfaction and performance from the gamified group were compared with a control group that followed traditional didactic methods. Despite the fact that the sample size was relatively small, the results were promising, showing significant increases in class attendance and final grades. Moreover, students participating in the gamified cohort considered their learning experience very engaging and motivating, thus encouraging the adoption of this technique in other courses.

Therefore, it is imperative to adopt appropriate rainwater harvesting and reuse technique(s) by promoting soil and water management research to sustain crop productivity. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) is a primary stable crop of Sudan. Extensive field experiments were conducted to study the effect of water harvesting techniques (WHTs) and supplemental irrigation (SI) on infiltration rate (IR), soil moisture content (SMC), growth and productivity of sorghum during two rainy seasons (2012 and 2013). RESULTSThe results showed that the WHTs and SI affected the soil physical properties, growth and productivity parameters of sorghum. The results indicated that the tied-ridging with SI (TRwSI) produced the highest values of accumulative IR, SMC and sorghum productivity (115mm, 13% and 4000kgh(-1), in season 2012, respectively, whereas in season 2013 the values were 145mm, 10% and 5000kgh(-1), for accumulative IR, SMC and sorghum productivity, respectively. Basin with SI (BwSI) ranked second, next to TRwSI in the both seasons. CONCLUSIONHence, water harvesting and SI are expected to play a significant role in terms of sustainable agricultural and socio-economic development in western Sudan and similar areas.

The study was performed in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in three phases: in 1999 (T1), in 2003 (T2) and in 2011 (T3). The study was carried out by means of anonymous questionnaires among university students aged 19-24. Results. The results show that among girls the lifetime illicit drugs use increased statistically significantly from 2.5% in 1999 to 7.5% in 2003 and to 15% in 2011. Among boys the trend was also increasing, the prevalence of illicit drug use was 14.2% at T1, 18.1% at T2, and it increased dramatically to 30.6% at T3. The percentage of students reporting cannabis use was almost identical with the total prevalence of illicit drug use.

The results of the bivariate correlation analyses show that lifetime illicit drug use was associated with having friends who experimented with illicit drugs both among boys and girls. Moreover, girls who declared stress management problems and depressive episodes were more likely to try illicit drugs, while among boys illicit drug use was associated with poorer academic performance. Conclusions. The data pointed out by our study call for comprehensive actions regarding the prevention of illicit drug use among Romanian young people.

82,"Background: The ultimate ambient-intelligent care room contains numerous sensors and devices to monitor the patient, sense and adjust the environment and support the staff. This sensor-based approach results in a large amount of data, which can be processed by current and future applications, e. g., task management and alerting systems. Today, nurses are responsible for coordinating all these applications and supplied information, which reduces the added value and slows down the adoption rate. The aim of the presented research is the design of a pervasive and scalable framework that is able to optimize continuous care processes by intelligently reasoning on the large amount of heterogeneous care data. Methods: The developed Ontology-based Care Platform (OCarePlatform) consists of modular components that perform a specific reasoning task. Consequently, they can easily be replicated and distributed. Complex reasoning is achieved by combining the results of different components. To ensure that the components only receive information, which is of interest to them at that time, they are able to dynamically generate and register filter rules with a Semantic Communication Bus (SCB). This SCB semantically filters all the heterogeneous care data according to the registered rules by using a continuous care ontology. The SCB can be distributed and a cache can be employed to ensure scalability. Results: A prototype implementation is presented consisting of a new-generation nurse call system supported by a localization and a home automation component. The amount of data that is filtered and the performance of the SCB are evaluated by testing the prototype in a living lab. The delay introduced by processing the filter rules is negligible when 10 or fewer rules are registered. Conclusions: The OCarePlatform allows disseminating relevant care data for the different applications and additionally supports composing complex applications from a set of smaller independent components. This way, the platform significantly reduces the amount of information that needs to be processed by the nurses. The delay resulting from processing the filter rules is linear in the amount of rules. Distributed deployment of the SCB and using a cache allows further improvement of these performance results.

83,"As one of the most important tasks in computer vision, online object tracking plays a critical role in numerous lines of research, which has drawn a lot of researchers' attention and be of many realistic applications. This paper develops a novel tracking algorithm based on the bag-of-local-patches representation with the discriminative learning scheme. In the first frame, a codebook is learned by applying the Kmeans algorithm to a set of densely sampled local patches of the tracked object, and then used to represent the template and candidate samples. During the tracking process, the similarities between the coding coefficients of the candidates and template are chosen as the likelihood values of these candidates. In addition, we propose effective model updating and discriminative learning schemes to capture the appearance change of the tracked object and incorporate the discriminative information to achieve a robust matching. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on some challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs better than other state-of-the-art tracking methods.

84,"Aim: It has been reported that a great proportion of mental health disorders have an origin in early childhood. In order to evaluate factors possibly associated with children's health, the health monitoring units have been established since 2004 in six study regions in Bavaria, Germany. The second health monitoring survey, implemented in 2005-06, focuses on the mental health status of preschool children. The goal of this study is (1) to examine the association of sociodemographic and environmental factors with mental health and (2) to analyze the applicability of the results of the health monitoring units to all preschool children in Bavaria by calculating weighting factors. Methods: Data on 6206 preschool children are available. Logistic regression analysis is applied to analyze possible associations with mental health. A weighting method is applied to correct for deviances compared to the whole population of preschool children in Bavaria (N =132,783). Results: 11% of preschool children show mental health problems. Regarding different indicators of sociodemographic status, low household income [unadjusted OR 3.34, 95% CI: 2.23-4.98] shows the strongest association of mental health problems. Non-accessibility of green space [unadjusted OR 2.74, 95% CI: 1.87-4.00] is also strongly associated with mental health. The results of the unweighted and weighted analysis are similar. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that sociodemographic status and factors in the living environment show associations with mental health of children. Based on the results of the unweighted and weighted analyses, the second health monitoring analysis shows little deviances compared to data of all Bavarian preschool children. Therefore, the results can be compared to all Bavarian preschool children. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

85,"Absolutely secure communication should be implemented only through the 'one-time pad' proposed by Shannon, requires that physical random numbers with rates matched with the associated communication systems be used as secret keys. With the wide application of the WDM technology in optical communication, the single channel rate of the current digital communication system has exceeded 10 Gb/s and developed towards 100 Gb/s. To ensure the absolute security of such a large capacity communication, a large number of real-time, and secure random numbers are needed. Secure random numbers are commonly produced through utilizing physical random phenomena, called physical random number generators. However, conventional physical random number generators are limited by the low bandwidth of the applied entropy sources such as thermal noise, photon-counting and chaotic electrical circuits, and thus have typical low bit rates of the order of Mb/s. In recent years, chaotic lasers attracted wide attention due to their generation of secure, reliable and high-speed random number sequences, and so due to their coherent merits such as high bandwidth, large amplitude fluctuation and ease of integration. There have been lots of schemes based on laser chaos for high-speed random number generation, but most of them execute the random number extractions from the associated laser chaos in the electrical domain and thus their generation rates are faced with the well-known 'electrical bottleneck'. On the other hand, all-optical random number generation (AO-RNG) methods are all signal processes in the optical domain, so they can efficiently overcome this rate limitation and have a great potential in generating ultrafast random numbers of several dozens or hundreds of Gb/s. However, there is no experimental report on its realization of AO-RNG. One of the obstacles in the way for the AO-RNG achievement is to implement the fast and real-time all-optical sampling of the entropy signals (i.e., laser chaos). In this paper, we present a principal experimental demonstration of the feasibility in the all-optical sampling of the chaotic light signal through constructing a TOAD-based all-optical sampler with a polarization-independent semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). Specifically, we experimentally generate chaotic laser signals using an optical feedback semiconductor laser and finally complete a 5 GSa/s real-time and high-fidelity all-optical sampling of the chaotic laser with a bandwidth of 6.4 GHz. Further experimental results show that whether the optical sampling period is proportional to the external cavity feedback time or not has a great effect on the weak periodic suppression of the chaotic signal: only when both of them are out of proportion, can the weak periodicity of the original chaotic signal be effectively eliminated; and this is favorable for the generation of high-quality physical random numbers. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to realize all-optical sampling of chaotic signal in experiments.

86,"BIM (building information modelling) has developed into a powerful solution that can improve many aspects of construction industry. Current research regarding the impact of orientation on a building's energy needs seldom tap into the potential of BIM. This study investigates the impact of orientation on energy consumption in small-scale construction, and assesses how BIM can be used to facilitate this process. The methods adopted are three-fold. Firstly, a real-life building is modelled using Revit, one of the leading BIM tools. Secondly, through green building Extensible Markup Language, the model is exported to Green Building Studio, one of the leading energy simulation software. Thirdly, in the Green Building Studio, different building orientations are adopted and their impacts of the whole building energy are investigated. Based on the analysis of the energy consumption corresponding to the different orientations, it emerged that a well-orientated building can save a considerable amount of energy throughout its life cycle. Specifically, a total electricity use difference of 17 056 kWh and a total gas use difference of 27 988 MJ leading to a combined energy cost savings of 878 pound throughout a 30 year period between the best (+180 degrees) and worst (+45 degrees) orientations of the building was achieved.

87,"Assistive Technologies (AT) are an application area where several Artificial Intelligence techniques and tools have been successfully applied to support elderly or impeded people on their daily activities. However, approaches to AT tend to center in the user-tool interaction, neglecting the user's connection with its social environment (such as caretakers, relatives and health professionals) and the possibility to monitor undesired behaviour providing both adaptation to a dynamic environment and early response to potentially dangerous situations. In previous work we have presented COAALAS, an intelligent social and norm-aware device for elderly people that is able to autonomously organize, reorganize and interact with the different actors involved in elderly-care, either human actors or other devices.

88,"AimBy investigating the association of urodynamics and urogenital nerve growth factor (NGF) levels in vaginal mesh surgery, we may be able to associate the likelihood of postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms developing as a result of synthetic mesh implanted for pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. MethodsThirty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: mesh, sham (no mesh), and control. Urodynamic study and NGF analysis of the urogenital tissues were done and results were compared among all groups. The urodynamic studies of the mesh and sham groups were further divided into the 4th and 10th days. A P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsAll rats survived and no complications were observed during the post-implantation period. Histological evaluation showed intense acute inflammatory reaction on days 4 and 7 in the mesh and sham groups when compared to the control. The mesh group showed a larger area of inflammation as compared to the sham. The NGF levels increased significantly in the mesh and sham groups on the 4th and 10th days when compared to the control (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Both the mesh and sham groups had shorter voiding interval and lower voiding volume on days 4 and 10 when compared to the control group (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). The magnitude on increasing NGF level and decreasing voiding interval and voiding volume was significantly more on the mesh group than the sham group. ConclusionA higher level of NGF in the early days post-transvaginal mesh implantation is associated with a shorter voiding interval and a smaller bladder capacity, which represents abnormal lower urinary tract symptoms following transvaginal mesh implantation.

89,"Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are communities of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens and bryophytes in varying proportions, which live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimeters of the soil in arid and semiarid regions. As biocrusts are highly relevant for ecosystem processes like carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling, a correct characterization of their spatial distribution is required. Following this objective, considerable efforts have been devoted to the identification and mapping of biocrusts using remote sensing data, and several mapping indices have been developed. However, their transferability to different regions has only rarely been tested. In this study we investigated the transferability of two multispectral indices, i.e. the Crust Index (CI) and the Biological Soil Crust Index (BSCI), and two hyperspectral indices, i.e. the Continuum Removal Crust Identification Algorithm (CRCIA) and the Crust Development Index (CDI), in three sites dominated by biocrusts, but with differences in soil and vegetation composition. Whereas multispectral indices have been important and valuable tools for first approaches to map and classify biological soil crusts, hyperspectral data and indices developed for these allowed to classify biocrusts at much higher accuracy. While multispectral indices showed Kappa (kappa) values below 0.6, hyperspectral indices obtained good classification accuracy (kappa similar to 0.8) in both the study area where they had been developed and in the newly tested region. These results highlight the capability of hyperspectral sensors to identify specific absorption features related to photosynthetic pigments as chlorophyll and carotenoids, but also the limitation of multispectral information to discriminate between areas dominated by biocrusts, vegetation or bare soil. Based on these results we conclude that remote sensing offers an important and valid tool to map biocrusts. However, the spectral similarity between the main surface components of drylands and biocrusts demand for mapping indices based on hyperspectral information to correctly map areas dominated by biocrusts at ecosystem scale.

90,"A study is presented to determine if substituting an internal combustion engine (ICE) by an electric motor powered by a fuel cell stack can be a viable option to increase the service ceiling of an available light unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), extending it to 10,000 m. As a first condition, the stack has to be capable of supplying the minimum power required for horizontal leveled flight at this altitude, which is a function of the UAV total mass. A second step examines if the UAV can transport the energy required to reach the desired service ceiling without exceeding the maximum mass that can be loaded, considering that both hydrogen and oxygen have to be carried on-board. A particularly light PEM fuel cell stack is proposed as a suitable power source. A realistic system is described to store the required amount of reactant gases maintaining the mass below the allowable limits. Results indicate that with its aerodynamic characteristics, the UAV should be capable of ascending up to 10,000 m with the described fuel cell and gas storage system.

92,"A system for measuring the dielectric propel-ties of cereal grains from 1 to 350 MHz with a coaxial sample holder is presented. Several polar alcohols were used to calibrate and verify permittivity measurements obtained with a signal-flow graph model from the full two-part S-parameter measurements. At the lowest frequencies (1-25 MHz), where the phase measurements are less accurate, a lumped parameter model was used for the dielectric loss factor measurements. The system was calibrated with measurements on air and decanol and verified with measurements on octanol, hexanol, and pentanol. The standard error for the polar alcohols used for verification was 2.3% for the dielectric constant and 7.6% for the dielectric loss factor. Although measurements were taken on static samples, the sample holder is designed to accommodate flowing grain. Dielectric properties measurements at 25 degrees C were taken on four hard red winter wheat cultivars ranging in moisture content from about 9% to 21% with bulk densities varying from 0.66 to 0.83 g/cm(3).

93,"Availability of long term solar data and the quality of available data is usually an obstacle to the development of proposals for new concentrating solar power plants. Typical or representative meteorological years using hourly solar and weather data that has been selected to match long-term averages are often used to perform the preliminary design and performance assessment of solar power plants. Although the use of this data is convenient due to the reduced computational requirements in plant optimization, it may result in a simplistic prediction of plant operations that does not reflect the real plant performance by neglecting the impact of short-term variability in solar irradiance and the variations in weather and available solar energy for different years. This study conducts a systematic analysis of the influence of multi-year data sets with a range of different time step sizes (5,15, 30 and 60 min) and thermal storage capacities (4, 8 and 12 h) using the physical parabolic trough with molten salt storage model in NREL's System Advisor Model. Results indicate that the appropriateness of different step sizes is likely to vary depending on the purpose of the modelling; however, sensitivity to step size is reduced for larger storage capacities.

Detecting alcohol induced impairments in gait in daily life necessitates a continuous and unobtrusive gait monitoring system. Objectives: This paper introduces the development and use of a non-intrusive monitoring system to detect changes in gait induced by alcohol intoxication. Methods: The proposed system employed a pair of sensorized smart shoes that are equipped with pressure sensors on the insole. Gait features were extracted and adjusted based on individual's gait profile. The adjusted gait features were used to train a machine learning classifier to discriminate alcohol-impaired gait from normal walking. In experiment of pilot study, twenty participants completed walking trials on a 12 meter walkway to measure their sober walking and alcohol-impaired walking using smart shoes. Results: The proposed system can detect alcohol-impaired gait with an accuracy of 86.2% when pressure value analysis and person-dependent model for the classifier are applied, while statistical analysis revealed that no single feature was discriminative for the detection of gait impairment. Conclusions: Alcohol-induced gait disturbances can be detected with smart shoe technology for an automated monitoring in ubiquitous environment. We demonstrated that personal monitoring and machine learning-based prediction could be customized to detect individual variation rather than applying uniform boundary parameters of gait.

To reduce the disturbances caused by this type of load, we propose, in this paper, a new control strategy of a shunt active filter. Our method aims to improve electrical quantity behavior in steady and dynamic states, while reducing the installing cost of the filter, through eliminating AC line voltage sensors. This is established by Direct Power Control (DPC), based on Virtual Flux (VF) estimation of the electrical network, using a switching function table. Facing disturbances affecting the electrical network, we have integrated a Phase Locked Loop (PLL), and have implemented and tested our new control strategy in a Matlab/Simulink environment. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the active filter control algorithm in eliminating harmonic currents, and shows an improvement in the reactive power injected from nonlinear loads, which has allowed us to confirm the robustness of the proposed strategy.

Previous BRC research has demonstrated a strong capacity for pollutant removal; however, long-term sequestration of pollutants within soil media can elevate concentrations to levels fostering environmental and human health risks. Soil media samples were collected from an 11 year-old BRC in Charlotte, NC, and analyzed for the accumulation and spatial distribution of zinc, copper, and phosphorus. Pollutant distribution varied significantly with respect to depth and ordinate distance from the BRC inlet. Zinc concentrations (0.9-228.6 mg kg(-1) soil) exceeded environmental thresholds and phosphorus concentrations (5.1-173.3 mg kg(-1) soil) increased from initial levels by a factor of seven; however, notable accumulation was restricted to the BRC forebay. Maximum zinc and copper concentrations in soil media did not exceed 1% of mandatory cleanup levels and with regular maintenance of the forebay, the effective life of BRC media should exceed the life of the developments they treat.

97,"As non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are expected to replace DRAM in the near future, new challenges have emerged. For example, NVMs have slow and power-consuming writes, and limited write endurance. In addition, NVMs have a data remanence vulnerability, i.e., they retain data for a long time after being powered off. NVM encryption alleviates the vulnerability, but exacerbates the limited endurance by increasing the number of writes to memory. We observe that, in current systems, a large percentage of main memory writes result from data shredding in operating systems, a process of zeroing out physical pages before mapping them to new processes, in order to protect previous processes' data. In this paper, we propose Silent Shredder, which repurposes initialization vectors used in standard counter mode encryption to completely eliminate the data shredding writes. Silent Shredder also speeds up reading shredded cache lines, and hence reduces power consumption and improves overall performance. To evaluate our design, we run three PowerGraph applications and 26 multiprogrammed workloads from the SPEC 2006 suite, on a gem5-based full system simulator. Silent Shredder eliminates an average of 48.6% of the writes in the initialization and graph construction phases. It speeds up main memory reads by 3.3 times, and improves the number of instructions per cycle (IPC) by 6.4% on average. Finally, we discuss several use cases, including virtual machines' data isolation and user-level large data initialization, where Silent Shredder can be used effectively at no extra cost.

Methods: This was a retrospective study of a consecutive cohort that included 322 emergency department (ED) patients with a diagnosis of renal colic from our hospital, from June 2014 to September 2015. Pain intensity (PI) was recorded using a visual analog scale (VAS) at different time-points after treatment. The primary outcome was defined as a decrease of 50% or more in the mean PI. The need for rescue analgesics in 120 min and occurrence of adverse effects were considered as secondary outcomes. Results: Of 322 eligible patients, 249 patients were analyzed in this study: 125 patients received ketorolac plus drotaverine and 124 patients received ketorolac only. There were significant differences in PI between the two groups at 30min and 120 min (PI: [OR 1.573, 95% Cl: 1.007-3.054, P-30 min = 0.047], [OR 2.938, 95% Cl: 1.11-7.78, P-120 min = 0.03] in multivariable logistic regression) (PI: [OR 1.869, 95% Cl: 1.119-3.121, P-30 min = 0.017], [OR 2.938, 95% Cl: 1.117.78, P-120 min = 0.03] in univariable logistic regression). Moreover, significant differences were also found in PI in subgroup analysis of patients with mid and proximal ureteric stones (PI: [OR 3.888, 95% Cl: 1.409-10.729, P-30 min = 0.009] in multivariable logistic regression) (PI: [OR 3.476, 95% Cl: 1.363-8.865, P-30 min = 0.009] in univariable logistic regression). Pain relief at 120 min was obtained in 119 patients (95.2%) receiving combined therapy and in 106 patients (85.5%) receiving ketorolac (P = 0.011). Rescue analgesics were required in six patients (4.8%) receiving combined therapy and 18 patients (14.5%) receiving ketorolac (P = 0.009). Adverse events were similar between the two groups: 20 (16%) in the combined group and 16 (13%) in the ketorolac group (P = 0.843). Conclusion: Ketorolac combined with drotaverine is effective in relief of acute renal colic, especially pain due to mid and proximal ureteric lithiasis, but did not decrease PI significantly in renal colic patients with renal and distal ureteral stones. On the other hand, combined therapy with ketorolac and drotaverine was associated with a reduced use of rescue analgesics.

The aim is to monitor the clinical quality at the national, regional, and hospital departmental levels and serve as a platform for research. Study population: The DCMR has nationwide coverage and contains information on patients diagnosed at hematology departments from January 2010 onward, including patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis, unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Main variables: Data are collected using standardized registration forms (so far up to four forms per patient), which are consecutively filled out online at time of diagnosis, after 2-year and 5-year follow-ups, and at end of follow-up. The forms include variables that describe clinical/paraclinical assessments, treatment, disease progression, and survival - disease-specific variables - as well as variables that are identical for all chronic myeloid malignancies. Descriptive data: By the end of 2014, the DCMR contained data on 2,690 patients with an inclusion rate of similar to 500 patients each year. Since the registry was established, annual reports have shown consistently high national coverage and data completeness, >= 90% and >= 88%, respectively. Conclusion: The DCMR is a national database used for monitoring the quality of patient care in patients with chronic myeloid malignancies, but until validation has been conducted, the data must be used with caution. However, the DCMR is a valuable data source accessible to clinicians and researchers.

Long-term care can reduce the quality of life for caregivers and result in both mental and physical exhaustion. However, little is known about caregiver burden and associated factors in China. Design. The study had a quantitative cross-sectional design. Methods. A total of 309 caregivers and their patients were included in the study. The patients' cognitive, psychological and functional status and their caregivers' burden, sleep quality and mental state were evaluated. Descriptive analyses, single-factor regression and stepwise factor regression were used to determine the effects of various factors on caregiver burden. Results. Older females and spouses still play an important role in providing family care for those with dementia. Most of the caregivers were the sole full-time caregiver and had little time for themselves. Sleepiness was a common physical problem for caregivers, and some of them had moderate to severe depression and anxiety. A lower functional status of the patient was associated with higher caregiver burden. Poorer physical status compared with before caregiving began, lower life satisfaction, and higher degrees of depression and anxiety were associated with higher caregiver burden. Conclusion. Depression, anxiety and sleep problems are the main challenges that are faced by family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Caregivers' functional status, lower life satisfaction, depression and anxiety influenced caregiver burden. Caregiver burden was related to the severity of the patient's dementia and the personal factors of the caregivers. Relevance to clinical practice. To provide information about caregivers' current status while caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease and to understand caregiver burden and its related factors. Professionals who work with Alzheimer's disease should pay more attention to caregiver burden, especially those with mental and physical problems.

110,"Aims and objectives. To explore and describe how young adults between 18-25 years of age experienced growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis and how these experiences continue to influence their daily lives. Background. Chronic parental illness is occurring in about 10% of families worldwide, but little is known about how the children experience growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis during their childhood and into young adulthood. Design. We chose a qualitative design using a phenomenological approach based on Giorgi. Methods. Exploratory and open-ended interviews with 14 young adults were conducted. Results. The essence of the phenomenon of having a parent with multiple sclerosis was synthesized into 'Striving for balance between caring and restraint' from two themes 'caring' and 'restraint' and eight subthemes. Participants' experiences of caring for parents with multiple sclerosis continued influencing their other close relationships, in which they tended to assume responsibility while concealing some of their feelings and desires. Most participants showed restraint among parents with and without multiple sclerosis, friends and partners. Conclusion. It seems that one of the greatest challenges of having a parent with multiple sclerosis is achieving a balance between caring for others and asserting one's own desires. Relevance to clinical practice. Healthcare professionals can support the family by encouraging family members to participate in consultations and to assist the parents in providing information about multiple sclerosis and its symptoms to the children. Parents might need assistance in applying for help with domestic chores or referrals to support groups for their children or other family members.

111,"AimRapid pacing (RP) is a regularly used model to induce heart failure in dogs. The aim of the study was to evaluate Ca2+ handling, left ventricular (LV) contractile response during Ca2+ administration compared to exercise, as well as oxygen consumption and mechanical efficiency after 48h of RP. MethodsFifty-three mongrel dogs were instrumented to measure LV pressure, LV fractional shortening, regional wall thickening and coronary blood flow. Contractile reserve was measured with isoproterenol and intravenous (IV) Ca2+ administration. To assess the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), post-extrasystolic potentiation (PESP) and SR Ca2+ uptake were measured. A graded treadmill test was performed in baseline and after RP (n=14). In a separate group of animals (n=5), myocardial performance and oxygen consumption were measured using a wide range of loading conditions. ResultsLeft ventricular contractility was significantly decreased upon cessation of pacing. The contractile response to isoproterenol was blunted compared to a preserved response to IV Ca2+. Post-extrasystolic potentiation was slightly increased after RP. Maximal velocity (V-max) of SR Ca2+ uptake was unchanged. Contractile response during exercise is attenuated after RP. External work is reduced, whereas oxygen consumption is preserved, provoking a reduced mechanical efficiency. ConclusionForty-eight-hours RP provokes a reversible LV dysfunction, while the SR function and response to exogenous Ca2+ are preserved. This is compatible with an intracellular functional remodelling to counteract Ca2+ overload provoked by RP. Left ventricular dysfunction is accompanied by a reduced contractile reserve, but an unchanged oxygen consumption, illustrating an alteration in oxygen utilization.

112,"Background: China's rapid urbanization over the past decades has exacerbated the problems of environmental degradation and health disparities. However, few studies have analysed the differences between urban and rural residents in relation to how environmental quality impacts health outcomes. This study examines the associations between Chinese people's perceptions of environmental quality and their self-rated health, particularly focusing on differences between rural and urban residents in environment-health relationships. Methods: Using a logistic regression model and data from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), a representative sample of data for 3,402 urban residents (46 +/- 16 years) and 2,439 rural residents (48 +/- 15 years) was analysed. The dependent variable used for the logistic regressions was whether or not respondents reported being healthy. Independent variables included respondents' evaluations of the living environment, and how frequently they participated in physical activities. Interaction terms were employed to measure the moderating effects of physical exercise on the relationship between perceived environmental quality and health. Results: The percentage of healthy urban residents was significantly larger than that of healthy rural respondents (70.87% versus 62.87%). Urban respondents living in areas with sufficient green space were more likely to report good health (OR = 0.749, CI = [0.628, 0.895]), while rural respondents without reliable access to fresh water were more likely to report poor health (OR = 0.762, CI = [0.612, 0.949]). Urban respondents who were exposed to green spaces and exercised frequently were 21.6 per cent more likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 1.216, CI = [1.047, 1.413]). Those who lived in areas with insufficient green space and exercised frequently were 19.1 per cent less likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 0.805, CI = [0.469, 1.381]). No evidence suggested that physical exercise exerted a moderating effect on the relationship between exposure to air pollution and health. Conclusions: On average, urban residents have better health than rural residents. Among four indicators for low environmental quality (air pollution, lack of green spaces, water pollution, uncertain access to freshwater resources), green space was an important determinant of urban residents' health status, while unreliable access to fresh water harmed rural residents' health. Physical exercise moderated the effects of exposure to green spaces on urban residents' health.

113,"As recent heterogeneous system designs integrate general purpose processors, GPUs, and other specialized accelerator devices into a single platform to provide both power and performance benefits, it is important to support efficient dispatching mechanisms in terms of performance and programmability. This work proposes models for integrating hardware accelerators with applications executing under standard operating systems on an embedded processor. Instead of using direct mapping of accelerator units to user applications, or using legacy drivers that incur communication overheads and large programming effort, we develop an abstraction layer in kernel driver which driver communicates with a custom dispatcher to interface a number of hardware accelerators. At the same time we remove the need to include IOMMUs for virtual-to-physical translation from the device side, and the need to perform copies from user to kernel space when offtoading computational instensive tasks to the accelerators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions running real applications on a prototype hybrid heterogeneous System-on-Chip platform.

114,"ArchiveDB is the data archive for all scientific and technical data collected at the Wendelstein 7-X project. It is a distributed system allowing continuous data archival. ArchiveDB has demanding requirements regarding performance efficiency (storage performance of 30 GB/s during experiments, expected storage amount of 1.4 PB/year), reliability (availability of 364 days/year), maintainability (testability) and portability (including change of hardware and software). Data acquisition with continuous operation and high time resolutions (up to nanoseconds scale) for physics data is supported as well as long-term recording up to 24 h/7 days for operational data (similar to 1 Hz rate). Moreover, all results of data analysis are stored in the archive. Another challenge, uniform retrieval of measured and analyzed data, allowing time and structure information as selection criteria, is mastered as well. The key concepts of data storage and retrieval are: (1) partitioning of incoming data in groups and stream, (2) chunking of data in boxes of manageable size covering a finite time period, and (3) indexing of data using absolute time as ordering and indexing criteria. Continuous operation of the ArchiveDB software and hardware for various systems and components relevant to Wendelstein 7-X has been done successfully for several years, thus, showing that the key requirements are satisfied. The overall data amount so far has reached 7 Terabyte over 9 years of data taking. Round-the-clock operation of the archive is in place since 5 years. Initial plasma operation OP1.1 of Wendelstein 7-X has been supported with no downtime during the whole experimental campaign. The paper describes the software engineering concepts that have been used, consolidated and refined over the years of continuing productive ArchiveDB use and development.

116,"As a result of the application of a technique of multistep processes stochastic models construction the range of models, implemented as a self-consistent differential equations, was obtained. These are partial differential equations (master equation, the Fokker-Planck equation) and stochastic differential equations (Langevin equation). However, analytical methods do not always allow to research these equations adequately. It is proposed to use the combined analytical and numerical approach studying these equations. For this purpose the numerical part is realized within the framework of symbolic computation. It is recommended to apply stochastic Runge-Kutta methods for numerical study of stochastic differential equations in the form of the Langevin. Under this approach, a program complex on the basis of analytical calculations metasystem Sage is developed. For model verification logarithmic walks and Black-Scholes two-dimensional model are used. To illustrate the stochastic ""predator-prey"" type model is used. The utility of the combined numerical-analytical approach is demonstrated.

In this paper, a new switching function is built which can be used in the distribution network with single power supply and multi power supplies. A regional processing method is used in this paper, which divides the distribution network into several independent regions, then the fault locating algorithm is used in these independent regions. The regions without DG connection are eliminated if fault current is not detected. So the complexity of computation of fault-section location is reduced. Ant colony algorithm is a good optimization algorithm of swarm intelligence. Because of its positive feedback, fault tolerance and distributed computing features, good application effect of locating faulty section in distribution network can be attained. In order to overcome the disadvantages such as large amounts of calculation, long searching time, local optimal. Ant colony algorithm is improved by adaptive dynamic modifying pheromone. Ant system with elitist strategy and MMAS are also used in this paper. This improved algorithm is used in distribution network with multi distributed generators.

Patients and Methods: T2DM patients with a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate of 30-300 mg/gCr who were attending the medical clinic in the Tsugaru region in Japan were enrolled into this prospective, observational study for 36 months (N= 317). We investigated the rate of remission (UAE= 300 mg/gCr; overt proteinuria) 36 months after study registration. Results: The number of patients whose UAE levels were= 300 mg/gCr (DN progression) at 36 months after registration was 32 (13.7%). From multiple logistic regression analysis, the sole factor that contributed to remission at 36 months after registration was the UAE levels at registration (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00, p=0.003), and the factors that contributed to progression at 36 months after registration were the levels of UAE (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02, p=0.000) and systolic blood pressure (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-1.00, p=0.033) at registration. Conclusion: Results suggest that patients with less severe microalbuminuria among microalbuminuric patients might more commonly experience DN remission and that earlier intervention is very important for promoting microalbuminuria remission in DN.

These radars systems consist of a large number of transmit/receive modules (TRMs) which are electronically scanned in a tight time-synchronized manner. This requires digital control to move closer to the radio front end on the antennas. Other emerging technologies, such as cognitive radars and MIMO radars, will continue to drive the need for complex timing, synchronization, and high mix RF and digital measurement requirements. To meet these challenges, radar engineers will need a platform based approach which delivers capabilities such as multi-channel phase aligned measurements over wide bandwidths and high-throughput streaming. This paper discusses the fundamentals of AESA radars and trends in radar systems. It analyzes the impact of these trends on test system architecture and explains how the advances in PXI modular instrumentation can meet these challenging requirements.

124,"As part of curriculum changes in South Africa, an introductory programming language, Scratch, must first be taught before switching to the well-established teaching of Delphi. The nature of programming in Scratch is considerably different from that in Delphi. It was assumed that the teaching of Scratch as introductory programming language could support learners' understanding of Delphi. Teachers did not receive much training in Scratch. This study explores teachers' experiences of their first year of the teaching of Scratch. The purpose of the research was to understand how Scratch can be used effectively as a transitioning language to Delphi and to deduce guidelines for teaching Scratch as introduction to object-oriented programming in Delphi. A qualitative research method, within the interpretive paradigm, was selected for this research. Interviews were done with eight randomly selected Information Technology (IT) teachers in the province of North-West, South Africa to gain insight into their experiences of teaching Scratch in 2012, the first year of implementing the new curriculum. Findings show that teachers were uncertain how to teach programming concepts and how to integrate problem solving and algorithm design into teaching Scratch. The focus of teaching was on Scratch, instead of on teaching programming concepts with Scratch. Emerging guidelines emphasise the integration of problem solving and algorithm design; the creation of opportunities to expose learners to error handling and program testing; and the inculcatation of programming concepts. We furthermore recommend active teaching-learning strategies such as pair programming.

125,"Appropriately merging visual words are an effective dimension reduction method for the bag-of-visual-words model in image classification. The approach of hierarchically merging visual words has been extensively employed, because it gives a fully determined merging hierarchy. Existing supervised hierarchical merging methods take different approaches and realize the merging process with various formulations. In this paper, we propose a unified hierarchical merging approach built upon the graph-embedding framework. Our approach is able to merge visual words for any scenario, where a preferred structure and an undesired structure are defined, and, therefore, can effectively attend to all kinds of requirements for the word-merging process. In terms of computational efficiency, we show that our algorithm can seamlessly integrate a fast search strategy developed in our previous work and, thus, well maintain the state-of-the-art merging speed. To the best of our survey, the proposed approach is the first one that addresses the hierarchical visual word mergence in such a flexible and unified manner. As demonstrated, it can maintain excellent image classification performance even after a significant dimension reduction, and outperform all the existing comparable visual word-merging methods. In a broad sense, our work provides an open platform for applying, evaluating, and developing new criteria for hierarchical word-merging tasks.

126,"A soft parameter function penalized normalized maximum correntropy criterion (SPF-NMCC) algorithm is proposed for sparse system identification. The proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm is derived on the basis of the normalized adaptive filter theory, the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) algorithm and zero-attracting techniques. A soft parameter function is incorporated into the cost function of the traditional normalized MCC (NMCC) algorithm to exploit the sparsity properties of the sparse signals. The proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm is mathematically derived in detail. As a result, the proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm can provide an efficient zero attractor term to effectively attract the zero taps and near-zero coefficients to zero, and, hence, it can speed up the convergence. Furthermore, the estimation behaviors are obtained by estimating a sparse system and a sparse acoustic echo channel. Computer simulation results indicate that the proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm can achieve a better performance in comparison with the MCC, NMCC, LMS (least mean square) algorithms and their zero attraction forms in terms of both convergence speed and steady-state performance.

The method of the spherical harmonic analysis with the selection of the spectrum of approximating harmonic with the greatest contribution was applied at creation of the model. The method essence consists in a such spherical harmonics series spectrum selection when the harmonics, with orthogonal projection exceeding an input data errors level appropriate number of times, are used in an approximating function. The comparative estimation of results obtained by the least squares process and throug offered method has executed. The usage of the least squares process when solving the problem of the spherical harmonics analysis at reconstructing the space distribution of the total electronic contents because of the poor conditionality of normal equations system, results in considerable errors of approximating strongly dependent on selected the length of series.

Some fundamental characteristics of the coupled flutter of a thin plate and a plate like structure, such as the flutter modes, the flutter branches, are explained by use of the ""Step-by-Step flutter analysis"". The flutter properties obtained by the 3DOF multi-modes-flutter analysis are compared with the ones by the 2DOF 2modes- flutter analysis t. 3DOF multi-modes flutter analysis is recommended to use for more accurate verification of the flutter property as the lessons from the aerodynamic behavior of the full-scale elastic model of Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. The reduction of the key equivalent aerodynamic derivatives, by suitable span-wise arrangement of the girders with different girder-shapes, is significantly effective to stabilize the flutter instability of a long spanned suspension bridge. Furthermore, the significantly similar formula with the Selberg formula can be derived under the simple assumptions. As an application of the coupled flutter, the generation mechanism of the propulsion force by use of coupled flutter motion is introduced. Finally, it is confirmed that the H-90 mode can produce the propulsion force by the test of the ship-navigation with the flapping plate controlled in the particular flutter mode is shown.

129,"As a powerful nonparametric Bayesian model, the infinite mixture model has been successfully used in machine learning and computer vision. The success of the in fi nite mixture model owes to the capability clustering and density estimation. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model for single-image super-resolution. Specifically, we combine the Dirichlet process and Gaussian process regression for estimating the distribution of the training patches and modeling the relationship between the low-resolution and high-resolution patches: 1) the proposed method groups the training patches by utilizing the clustering property of Dirichlet process; 2) the proposed method relates the low-resolution and highresolution patches by predicting the property of Gaussian process; and 3) the mentioned two points are not independent but jointly learned. Hence, the proposed method can make full use of the nonparametric Bayesian model. First, the Dirichlet process mixture model is used to obtain more accurate clusters for training patches. Second, Gaussian process regression is established on each cluster, and this directly reduces the computational complexity. Finally, the two procedures are learned simultaneously to gain the suitable clusters with the ability of prediction. The parameters can be inferred simply via the Gibbs sampling technique. Thorough super-resolution experiments on various images demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to some state-of-the-art methods.

Traditionally, social engineering attacks have always been a major cause of concern for Information Security departments. However, the theft, abuse and manipulation of personal information for malicious purposes has become even prolific since the mass adoption of social media and gaming applications by the average person, largely fueled by the boom in social media and gaming applications. These newly introduced and ever-evolving apps continue to introduce new vulnerabilities due to poor system design and coding practices and have led to a multitude of sophisticated attacks and digital crimes. Attacks such as, Malware infections, ransomware, Session Hijacking, SQL Injection, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks have been facilitated in part by the race to developing social media platforms, and applications. Hence, more effective countermeasures and prevention techniques are introduced to detect and minimize the resulting damage and losses associated with this trend. This paper presents a novel 'credentials crawling' proof of concept exploit to illustrate the ease with which such attacks can be launched. The proof of concept is implemented via a stealthy application, which has been implemented (in part) using a commercial of-the-shelf application (Camera Mouse 2011). The newly developed stealth robot uses stealth techniques to conceal itself from the intended target/victim. The proposed approach enables the developed robot application to remain undetected by leading commercial anti-virus solutions.

131,"Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of custom-fit mouthguards on the aerobic performance of soccer and futsal players under 17 (U-17). Material and methods: Forty players from 3 Brazilian clubs participated in the study. The athletes' aerobic performance was assessed through the 20-meter shuttle-run test. All athletes performed two tests with and without mouthguard. Two outcome variables were analyzed: (i) the total distance covered in the test (meters) and (ii) the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max). A questionnaire assessing the level of acceptance of mouthguards considering different parameters was administered to the athletes before the delivery of the mouthguards and after 2 weeks of use. The questionnaire used a visual analogue scale (VAS). Paired t-test was used to compare the results obtained from the shuttle-run tests and the questionnaires. Results: Mouthguards did not influence the aerobic performance of the players, considering both the total distance covered in the tests and the VO2 max. Stability was the parameter with the highest acceptance. Levels of acceptance regarding breathing (P = 0.022) and communication (P = 0.002) increased after mouthguards usage. Communication had the lowest level of acceptance considering all parameters assessed. Only 10% of the players reported receiving recommendations to use mouthguards while playing football or futsal. None of the participants reported having used mouthguards before. Conclusions: The use of custom-fit mouthguards does not affect the aerobic performance of soccer and futsal U-17 players. Future studies should focus on the development of appliances with maximum protection and minimum influence on communication.

132,"As senescence develops, cells sequentially acquire diverse senescent phenotypes along with simultaneous multistage gene reprogramming. It remains unclear what acts as the key regulator of the collective changes in gene expression at initiation of senescent reprogramming. Here we analyzed time series gene expression profiles obtained in two different senescence models in human diploid fibroblasts: replicative senescence and H2O2-induced senescence. Our results demonstrate that suppression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA methylation activity was an initial event prior to the display of senescent phenotypes. We identified seven DNMT1-interacting proteins, ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), EZH2, CHEK1, SUV39H1, CBX5, PARP1, and HELLS (also known as LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase) 1), as being commonly down-regulated at the same time point as DNMT1 in both senescence models. Knockdown experiments revealed that, among the DNMT1-interacting proteins, only UHRF1 knockdown suppressed DNMT1 transcription. However, UHRF1 overexpression alone did not induce DNMT1 expression, indicating that UHRF1 was essential but not sufficient for DNMT1 transcription. Although UHRF1 knockdown effectively induced senescence, this was significantly attenuated by DNMT1 overexpression, clearly implicating the UHRF1/DNMT1 axis in senescence. Bioinformatics analysis further identified WNT5A as a downstream effector of UHRF1/DNMT1-mediated senescence. Senescence-associated hypomethylation was found at base pairs -1569 to -1363 from the transcription start site of the WNT5A gene in senescent human diploid fibroblasts. As expected, WNT5A overexpression induced senescent phenotypes. Overall, our results indicate that decreased UHRF1 expression is a key initial event in the suppression of DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation and in the consequent induction of senescence via increasing WNT5A expression.

The present study investigates the binding and antagonistic characteristics of small non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e. gepants) in isolated rat brain and mesenteric resistance arteries. Methods: The antagonistic behavior of gepants was investigated in isolated rat mesenteric arteries using a wire myograph setup while binding of gepants to CGRP receptors was investigated in rat brain membranes using a radioligand competitive binding assay. Furthermore, the histological location of the key components of CGRP receptor (RAMP1 and CLR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Our functional studies clearly show that all gepants are reversible competitive antagonists producing Schild plot slopes not significantly different from unity and thus suggesting presence of a uniform CGRP receptor population in the arteries. A uniform receptor population was also confirmed by radioligand competitive binding studies showing similar affinities for the gepants in rat brain and mesenteric arteries, the exception being rimegepant which had 50-fold lower affinity in brain than mesenteric arteries. CLR and RAMP1 were shown to be located in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: The present results indicate that, despite species differences in the CGRP receptor affinity, the antagonistic nature of these gepants, the distribution pattern of CGRP receptor components and the mechanism behind CGRP-induced vasodilation seem to be similar in resistance-sized arteries of human and rats.

However, there are limited reports about the prevalence of these organisms in captive Eurasian wild boars worldwide. Therefore, we examined the occurrence and identified the species/assemblages/ genotypes of these pathogens in captive Eurasian wild boars, and estimated the zoonotic potential. Findings: Of 357 fecal samples collected from captive Eurasian wild boars in China, 155 (43.4%) were infected with Cryptosporidium, G. duodenalis and/or E. bieneusi. The infection rates significantly differed in different areas, but did not differ between wild boars kept indoors and outdoors. Three (0.8%), 11 (3.1%) and 147 (41.2%) fecal samples were positive for Cryptosporidium, G. duodenalis and E. bieneusi, respectively. Sequence analysis of SSU rRNA gene revealed that all of the Cryptosporidium strains belonged to C. scrofarum. Based on the sequence analysis of the agiardia gene of G. duodenalis, assemblages E and A were characterized. Fourteen E. bieneusi genotypes comprising five novel (WildBoar 7-11) and eight known (EbpC, F, CHG19, CHC5, PigEBITS5, D, RWSH4, SC02) genotypes were identified by ITS sequencing. EbpC was the most frequent genotype, detected in 85 specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 14 genotypes belonged to Group 1. Conclusions: This first report on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium, G. duodenalis and E. bieneusi in captive wild boars in China indicates that the presence of zoonotic species/assemblages/genotypes poses a threat to public health. The findings suggest that wild boars could be a significant source of human infection and water pollution.

135,"As urbanisation and land development rapidly increase, water quality stress due to urban stormwater runoff is becoming an increasingly prominent problem. Although a variety of technologies exist to improve urban runoff quality, ultra-urban areas pose a specific challenge.

Of the 18 storms analysed for TSS, 16 demonstrated an event mean concentration (EMC) less than the target value of 25 mg/l. However, no significant reduction of total phosphorus EMC occurred through the filters. Porosities and characteristic pore opening sizes of the field-exhumed geotextiles dropped 65-82%, accompanied by comparable permittivities; however, the final hydraulic conductivities of the field-exhumed geotextiles were still 25 times higher than that of a typical unclogged uniform sand. Stormwater TSS geotextile modelling developed in an earlier study was successful in predicting hydraulic conductivity decrease in the field.

136,"Background: Hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion (HFR) is an extracorporeal dialytic method that combines diffusion, convection and adsorption. HFR-Supra (HFR-S) is a second-generation system with increased convective permeability and adsorption capability. Previous studies suggested that HFR reduces oxidative stress compared to standard haemodialysis. The principal aim of the present study was to compare antioxidant vitamins behavior and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients treated with HFR and HFR-S. Methods: The study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, crossover trial. Forty-one patients were recruited from 19 dialysis centers and after a 4-month washout stabilization period in on-line hemodiafiltration (ol-HDF), each patient was randomized to a sequence of treatments (HFR-S followed by HFR or viceversa) with each treatment applied over 6 months. Plasma levels of Advanced Oxidation Protein Products, Total Antioxidant Status, vitamins C, A and E and their ligands (Retinol Binding Protein and total lipids) were measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. Results: Results show that the higher convective permeability of HFR-S with respect to HFR did not produce additional beneficial effects on the patients' oxidative status, a slight decrease of both Vitamin A and Retinol Binding Protein being the only difference registered in the long-term. However, as compared to ol-HDF, both the re-infusive techniques allowed to reduce the intradialytic loss of Vitamin C and, in the long-term, improve the patients' oxidative status and increase Retinol Binding Protein plasma values. No significant differences were found between the Vitamin C concentration of pre- and post cartridge UF neither in HFR-S nor in HFR showing that the sorbent resin does not adsorb Vitamin C. Conclusion: HFR-S and HFR are almost equivalent in term of impact on antioxidant vitamins and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients. Nonetheless, as compared to ol-HDF, both treatments produced a sensible sparing of Vitamin C and may represent a new approach for reducing oxidative stress and related complications in dialysis patients. Longterm effects of re-infusive treatments on patients' cardiovascular morbidity and mortality need to be evaluated.

137,"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the baseline function and results of arthroscopic cuff repair in shoulders with small and medium-sized full-thickness cuff tears with complete supraspinatus disruption compared with those with an intact anterior supraspinatus tendon. Methods: The study evaluated 112 subjects with small and medium-sized cuff tears. Subjects were grouped according to anterior supraspinatus integrity (83 shoulders intact, group 1; and 29 shoulders with anterior supraspinatus tendon disruption, group 2). Functional assessments included visual analogue scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and Constant score. Repair integrity was assessed by ultrasound examination. Results: Group 2 shoulders had greater mean tear width, length, and area (P < .0001) and greater supraspinatus muscle degenerative changes (P < .0001) compared with shoulders with an intact anterior supraspinatus tendon. There were no differences in demographics or baseline function (ASES score: 45 group 1 vs 46 group 2, P = .79; Constant score: 56 group 1 vs 52 group 2, P = .29) before surgery. There were no differences in any functional parameter (ASES score: 92 group 1 vs 93 group 2, P = .71; Constant score: 84 group 1 vs 85 group 2, P = .84) after surgery. There was no difference in tendon healing rates (93% group 1 vs 86% group 2; P = .26). Conclusions: In the setting of painful small and medium-sized rotator cuff tears, disruption of the anterior supraspinatus tendon was associated with greater tear size and more advanced supraspinatus muscle degeneration. However, anterior supraspinatus tendon integrity had no influence on the clinical presentation or the functional and structural results of cuff repair surgery.

138,"Aim: Amyloid-beta (A beta)-mediated neurotoxicity plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces oxidative stress and apoptosis. Linalool (LI) is a volatile monoterpene showing positive effect in AD treatment. This study was designed to research the protective effect of LI against neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits induced by A beta(1-40) in mice. Main methods: A beta(1-40) (4 mu g) solution was injected in the bilateral hippocampus to induce cognitive deficits of mice. The protective effects of LI were evaluated by behavioral tests and the related mechanism was further explored by observing the apoptosis and oxidative stress changes in the hippocampus of mice. Key findings: LI (100 mg/kg, i.p.) administration significantly improved the cognitive performance of model mice in Morris water maze test and step-through test. Meanwhile, LI effectively reversed the A beta(1-40) induced hippocampal cell injury in histological examination, apoptosis in TUNEL assay, changes of oxidative stress indicators (SOD, GPX, AChE). Besides, the activated cleaved caspase (caspase-3, caspase-9) was suppressed and Nrf2, HO-1 expression was elevated by LI treatment. Significance: LI could attenuate cognitive deficits induced by A beta, and the neuroprotective effect of LI might be mediated by alleviation of apoptosis, oxidative stress depending on activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. We could assume that LI has the potential to be a neuroprotective substance for AD therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

139,"Background: Image-guided endovascular interventions have gained increasing popularity in clinical practice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is emerging as an attractive alternative to X-ray fluoroscopy for guiding such interventions. Steering catheters by remote control under MRI guidance offers unique challenges and opportunities. Methods: In this review, the benefits and limitations of MRI-guided remote control intervention are addressed, and the tools for guiding such interventions in the magnetic environment are summarized. Designs for remote control catheter guidance include a catheter tip electromagnetic microcoil design, a ferromagnetic sphere-tipped catheter design, smart material-actuated catheters, and hydraulically actuated catheters. Remote control catheter guidance systems were compared and contrasted with respect to visualization, safety, and performance. Performance is characterized by bending angles achievable by the catheter, time to achieve bending, degree of rotation achievable, and miniaturization capacity of the design. Necessary improvements for furthering catheter design, especially for use in the MRI environment, are addressed, as are hurdles that must be overcome in order to make MRI guided endovascular procedures more accessible for regular use in clinical practice. Conclusions: MR-guided endovascular interventions under remote control steering are in their infancy due to issues regarding safety and reliability. Additional experimental studies are needed prior to their use in humans.

140,"Aim: We previously reported a protective effect of maternal omega-3 fatty acid supplements on the development of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated disease in infancy. This study assessed omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in maternal milk in relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation and the development of allergic disease in their infants. Methods: This study randomised 95 pregnant women at risk of having an allergic infant, to daily supplements of 2.6 g omega-3 LCPUFA or a placebo of 2.7 g soya bean oil from gestational week 25 until 3 months of lactation. Breast milk samples were collected as colostrum, at one and 3 months. Milk fatty acids were related to allergic outcome in the infants at 24 months. Results: Omega-3 milk fatty acids were higher in women who received omega-3 supplements than the placebo group (p < 0.01). Higher proportions of milk eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and a lower arachidonic/ eicosapentaenoic acid ratio were associated with an absence of IgE-associated disease in the infants. None of the children developed IgE-associated atopic eczema above a level of 0.83 mol% eicosapentaenoic acid in colostrum. [Correction added on 7 July 2016, after online publication: In the preceding sentence, the correct word should be "" above"" instead of "" below"" and this has been amended in this current version.] Conclusion: High omega-3 LCPUFA milk levels in mothers who received omega-3 LCPUFA supplements were related to fewer allergies in their children.

141,"As scientific applications become more data intensive, finding an efficient scheduling strategy for massive computing on network-based computing systems has drawn increasingly attention. Most existing scheduling models assume that all processors are idle at the beginning of workload assignment. In fact, in the real distributed computing environments, processors may still be occupied with any previous assigned workload when a new load arrives. The time period between busy to idle states of a processor is referred to as its release time. Based on the fact that processors have arbitrary release times, we propose a new divisible-load scheduling model with hybrid time constraints and design an effective global optimization genetic algorithm to solve it. Finally, experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

142,"Background: Pseudoparalysis is defined as active forward flexion less than 90 degrees with full passive motion. There is controversy about the ideal surgical management of a massive rotator cuff tear with pseudoparalysis. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to prospectively analyze the ability to reverse pseudoparalysis with an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). The hypothesis was that in the absence of substantial glenohumeral arthritis, preoperative fatty infiltration of grade 3 or higher and an acromiohumeral interval (AHI) of less than 7 mm would not prevent reversal of pseudoparalysis with an ARCR. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A prospective multicenter study of ARCR performed for preoperative pseudoparalysis was conducted. The minimum follow-up was 1 year. The mean patient age was 63 years, and pseudoparalysis was present for a mean of 4.2 months preoperatively. Preoperative radiographic evaluation included plain film evaluation of the AHI and Hamada classification and MRI evaluation of fatty degeneration and rotator cuff retraction. Functional outcome was determined by the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score, visual analog scale (VAS), and subjective shoulder value (SSV). Results: Of the 58 patients enrolled, 56 had at least 1 year of follow-up. Mean active forward flexion improved from 47 degrees preoperatively to 159 degrees postoperatively (P < .001). Statistically significant improvements were seen in the SST (from 2.8 preoperatively to 10.1 postoperatively), SSV (from 28 to 83), ASES Shoulder Score (from 37 to 88), and VAS (from 5.7 to 1.1) (P < .001). Pseudoparalysis was reversed in 53 of 56 patients (95%). There was no difference in the rate of reversal of pseudoparalysis between those patients with an AHI of less than 7 mm (88.2%) and those with an AHI of 7 mm or more (96.9%) (P =.289). Pseudoparalysis was reversed in all 8 of the patients with fatty degeneration of grade 3 or higher in 1 or more of the rotator cuff muscles. Conclusion: ARCR can lead to reversal of preoperative pseudoparalysis in patients with minimal preoperative glenohumeral arthritis. ARCR is a viable first line of treatment for patients with pseudoparalysis in the absence of advanced glenohumeral arthritis.

144,"Aim: Early intervention and prevention of serious mental disorders such as bipolar disorder has the promise of decreasing the burden associated with these disorders. With increasing early and preventive intervention efforts among cohorts such as those with a familial risk for bipolar disorder, there is a need to examine the associated ethical concerns. The aim of this review was to examine the ethical issues underpinning the clinical research on pre-onset identification and preventive interventions for bipolar disorder. Methods: We undertook a PubMed search updated to November 2014 incorporating search terms such as bipolar, mania, hypomania, ethic* (truncated), early intervention, prevention, genetic and family. Results: Fifty-six articles that were identified by this method as well as other relevant articles were examined within a framework of ethical principles including beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect for autonomy and justice. The primary risks associated with research and clinical interventions include stigma and labelling, especially among familial high-risk youth. Side effects from interventions are another concern. The benefits of preventive or early interventions were in the amelioration of symptoms as well as the possibility of minimizing disability, cognitive impairment and progression of the illness. Supporting the autonomy of individuals and improving access to stigma-free care may help moderate the potential challenges associated with the risks of interventions. Conclusions: Concerns about the risks of early identification and pre-onset interventions should be balanced against the potential benefits, the individuals' right to choice and by improving availability of services that balance such dilemmas.

Although the existing methods can achieve feasible performance for detecting the JitterBug covert timing channel, they are ineffective when the covert timing channels are implemented with sparse embedding, especially for low embedding probability. In this paper, a new method to detect JitterBug covert timing channel with sparse embedding is proposed, in which the timing intervals are first modeled in histogram statistics, and then the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is used for detection. In addition, the diversifications of the references and the model updating scheme in practical usage are analyzed. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective when the embedding probability is 0.3, while the existing methods can effective only when the embedding probability is larger than 0.6.

METHODS A comprehensive search of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases was performed to identify literature addressing the relationship between gastroparesis and psychological factors. Two researchers independently screened all references. Inclusion criteria were: an adult sample of gastroparesis patients, a quantitative methodology, and at least one of the following: (1) evaluation of the prevalence of psychopathology; (2) an outcome measure of anxiety, depression, or quality of life; and (3) evidence of a psychological intervention. Case studies, review articles, and publications in languages other than English were excluded from the current review. RESULTS Prevalence of psychopathology was evaluated by three studies (n = 378), which found that combined anxiety/ depression was present in 24% of the gastroparesis cohort, severe anxiety in 12.4%, depression in 21.8%-23%, and somatization in 50%. Level of anxiety and depression was included as an outcome measure in six studies (n = 1408), and while limited research made it difficult to determine the level of anxiety and depression in the cohort, a clear positive relationship with gastroparesis symptom severity was evident.Quality of life was included as an outcome measure in 11 studies (n = 2076), with gastroparesis patients reporting lower quality of life than population norms, and a negative relationship between quality of life and symptom severity. One study assessed the use of a psychological intervention for gastroparesis patients (n = 120) and found that depression and gastric function were improved in patients who received psychological intervention, however the study had considerable methodological limitations. CONCLUSION Gastroparesis is associated with significant psychological distress and poor quality of life. Recommendations for future studies and the development of psychological interventions are provided.

While abstracting Test Programs Sets from specific hardware is commonly referenced as a valuable tactic to reduce the risks of I/O obsolescence, it also requires significant up-front investment with a return that is later determined by the frequency of change. As systems become increasingly software-centric, a cost optimized development strategy requires bounding technology insertion options, evaluating the costs associated with developing driver and measurement layers across those options, and managing the costs of migrating across application software and operating systems as a function of time. This paper will discuss the evolving solution space for software dominated technology insertion strategies through an examination of the underlying compatibility of the COTS components at play.

149,"Attractiveness of magnesium alloys for structural applications is caused by their intrinsic properties i.e. low density and high specific strength. The main challenge in development of magnesium alloys is connected with requirement to fulfill the main function of structural materials i.e. to bear load. Wrought magnesium alloys possess strong basal texture which causes anisotropy of mechanical properties. It would be interesting to find out the way how to benefit from this anisotropic behavior of magnesium alloys. One way is to take into account strong basal texture and {1 0 -1 2} twinning in magnesium alloys under compressive deformation. Parallelepiped samples of AZ31 magnesium alloy were successively deformed in compression with 3.5% strain along two perpendicular directions. During first compression the sample contracts along the RD direction parallel to compression axis, elongates only in one perpendicular ND direction and no deformation is observed in third perpendicular TD direction. Subsequent compression along the ND direction recovers the initial shape of the sample. Microstructure analyses shows that the {1 0 -1 2} twinning is the main deformation mode during compression along the RD direction and twin variants which gives 0% strain to TD direction are predominant in microstructure. Twinfree microstructure is observed after subsequent compression along the ND direction. Crystallographic analyzes and calculations explain why reversible motion of twin boundaries is more favorable than nucleation of other twin variants in matrix grains during compression along the ND direction. The experiment presented in this article profile wrought magnesium alloy as smart material and emphasize the importance of strong {0 0 0 1}texture and {1 0 -1 2} twinning in obtaining the properties characteristic for smart materials. In the presented case, it is the ability to produce and recover significant strains in a controlled manner under compressive stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Where possible, attempts at direct comparison of outcomes among surgical techniques and surgical indications have been made. Results and Conclusions: Despite the heterogeneous reporting of clinical results, it is clear that surgical indications affect outcomes. Specifically, isolated subscapularis insufficiency shows the best prognosis with pectoralis major tendon transfer.

Methods: 64 breast-feeding children with CMPA-related AEDS (31 males and 33 females; mean age 5.56 +/- 2.41 months; 21 mild AEDS; 25 moderate AEDS; 18 severe AEDS) and 60 artificial feeding babies (33 males and 27 females; mean age 6.01 +/- 2.08 months; 26 mild AEDS; 19 moderate AEDS; 15 severe AEDS) were evaluated. In all patients serum IL-10 levels were detected. Results: Significant Score Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index point differences between breastfed and not breastfed children (p <0.001) have been detected. The serum IL-10 levels were lower in children with CMPA-related AEDS as compared to the healthy control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between serum IL-10 levels and SCORAD in both enrolled groups has been also noted. In particular, IL-10 levels, in both groups, were significantly lower in children with severe symptoms. Conversely, serum IL-10 levels were significantly increased in children with mild-severe symptoms in both groups. Furthermore, breastfed children, with lower severe symptoms, had higher serum IL-10 levels. Finally, serum total IgE levels were negatively correlated with serum IL-10 levels in both breastfed and non-breastfed children with CMPA-related AEDS (p < 0.001).

The aim of this study was to investigate food allergic adolescents' experiences and consequences of double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges. Methods: This qualitative, descriptive interview study included 17 adolescents aged 14-15 years with total elimination of cows' milk, hens' eggs or cod due to food allergies. The participants, who were initially identified from a large population-based cohort study, were interviewed 18 months after completing their challenges. Results: The double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge proved to be a complex experience for the adolescents, involving fear of potential reactions and the hope that the food could be reintroduced. Experiences during the challenge were described in three themes: facing fears in a secure environment, being hesitant but curious about unknown tastes and waiting for unknown food reactions. Experiences after the challenge were described in two themes: gaining control and freedom and continuing old habits. A negative challenge was not consistently associated with the reintroduction of the challenged food. Conclusion: This study highlighted the importance of considering the adolescents' expectations and experiences of the challenge and the reintroduction process to ensure desirable changes in their dietary habits. Follow-ups should be performed regardless of the outcome of challenges.

155,"As an interesting and emerging topic, co-saliency detection aims at simultaneously extracting common salient objects from a group of images. On one hand, traditional co-saliency detection approaches rely heavily on human knowledge for designing hand-crafted metrics to possibly reflect the faithful properties of the co-salient regions. Such strategies, however, always suffer from poor generalization capability to flexibly adapt various scenarios in real applications. On the other hand, most current methods pursue co-saliency detection in unsupervised fashions. This, however, tends to weaken their performance in real complex scenarios because they are lack of robust learning mechanism to make full use of the weak labels of each image. To alleviate these two problems, this paper proposes a new SP-MIL framework for co-saliency detection, which integrates both multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-paced learning (SPL) into a unified learning framework. Specifically, for the first problem, we formulate the co-saliency detection problem as a MIL paradigm to learn the discriminative classifiers to detect the co-saliency object in the ""instance-level"". The formulated MIL component facilitates our method capable of automatically producing the proper metrics to measure the intra-image contrast and the inter-image consistency for detecting co-saliency in a purely self-learning way. For the second problem, the embedded SPL paradigm is able to alleviate the data ambiguity under the weak supervision of co-saliency detection and guide a robust learning manner in complex scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets together with multiple extended computer vision applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework beyond the state-of-the-arts.

Method: In two hours, 163 individuals ascended by plane to 3700m. Demographic information, physiological and psychological measurements, cognitive function, physical work capacity tests and profile of mood states within one week prior to the departure and within 24 hours after arrival were examined. Results: HAH patients featured significantly higher vertebral artery diastolic velocity (V-d), heart rate (HR) and pulmonary artery diameter. HAH was also associated with a more negative mood state, including scores for tension anxiety, depression, hostility, fatigue and confusion, as well as lower vigor (all p values <0.05). Furthermore, negative emotions were positively related to HAH severity. HAH slightly decreased cognitive functioning. HR, V-d, lack of vigor, confusion and self-reported anxiety (all p values <0.05) were independent risk factors for HAH. We have identified three independent baseline predictors for HAH including internal diameter of the left ventricle (LVD), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and confusion score. Conclusions: Higher HR, V-d, confusion and self-reported anxiety and insufficient vigor were independent risk factors for HAH.

It is unknown if prolonged QT interval is associated with all-cause mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients as the electrolytes were relatively stable in PD. We therefore investigated the association of prolonged QT interval and all-cause mortality in chronic PD patients. MethodsThe QT intervals were measured in 2003 and all patients were followed to December 2012. A prolonged QT interval was defined as a QT interval>450ms. The association of prolonged QT interval with all-cause and cardiac-specific mortality was analyzed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. ResultsOf 306 patients, 196 (64%) patients had prolonged QT interval. The incidence density rate was 9.7 per 100 persons-years for all-cause mortality and 5.6 for cardiac specific mortality in patients with prolonged QT interval. Prolonged QT interval was associated with all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.59 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-2.39, P=0.03] and cardiac mortality (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.00-2.78, P=0.05) with adjustments for age, gender, diabetes, and vintage of dialysis. Longer QT interval (>500ms, 450-500ms, and<450ms) was significantly associated with a worse overall survival (P=0.03, log-rank test) and cardiac mortality free survival (P=0.05, log-rank test). ConclusionsProlonged QT interval was associated with all-cause and cardiac mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis. The association is independent of patient's age and diabetes.

To achieve an optimal power stage, an unified signal flow graph (USFG) model is developed. System transfer function and I/O impedance can be evaluated based on it. To verify the design approach, the paper demonstrates a step-up/down reconfigurable SC power converter with five optional gain ratios. A dual-loop control scheme is employed to reconfigure the converter according to the instantaneous line/load conditions. A low-power, digital controller is designed in the subthreshold region for the feedback control loop. The converter was fabricated with a 130-nm CMOS process. Experimental results show that its output can be continuously regulated from 0.4 to 2.2 V, while allowing the input voltage to randomly vary between 0.9 and 1.5 V. The line regulation is maintained below 1.4%, with a lowest value of 0.07%. The maximum efficiency of 90.22% is measured at 0.55-V output voltage and 20-mW load.

161,"Aim: The study assessed mRNA expression of podocyte-associated molecules in urinary sediments of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in relation to urinary podocytes, biomarkers of podocyte injury and of proximal tubule (PT) dysfunction. Methods: A total of 76 patients with type 2 DM and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in a cross-sectional study, and assessed concerning urinary podocytes, urinary mRNA of podocyte-associated genes, urinary biomarkers of podocyte damage and of PT dysfunction. Results: We found significant differences between urinary mRNA of podocyte-associated molecules in relation with albuminuria stage. In multivariable regression analysis, urinary mRNA of nephrin, podocin, alpha-actinin-4, CD2-associated protein, glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1), ADAM 10, and NF kappa B correlated directly with urinary podocytes, albuminuria, urinary -alpha1-microglobulin, urinary kidney-injury molecule-1, nephrinuria, urinary vascular endothelial growth factor, urinary advanced glycation end-products (AGE), and indirectly with eGFR (p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.808; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.825; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.805; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.663; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.726; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.720; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.724). Conclusions: In patients with type 2 DM there is an association between urinary mRNA of podocyte-associated molecules, biomarkers of podocyte damage, and of PT dysfunction. GLEPP1, ADAM10, and NF kappa B may be considered additional candidate molecules indicative of early diabetic nephropathy. AGE could be involved in this association.

162,"Bafa Lake is one of the largest Turkish Lagoon lakes in Aegean Region covering a surface area of 50km(2). Because of its water capacity and myriad benefits in aquaculture facility, agricultural activities and tourism. The lake is considered as an important wetland within Buyuk Menderes basin. This study investigate the aquaculture facilities and anthropogenic sources of pollutions and how they affect the water quality of Bafa Lake. The major factors that control the quality-of Bafa Lake water are agricultural activities in the basin, domestic and industrial wastes that come from Buyuk Menderes River and its surrounding lake, fisheries and aquaculture facilities. Contaminants located in the Lake are continuously having a negative impact on its water quality during the last three decades. The effect of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cultivation facilities on surface water quality in the Lake were determined. Water samples were taken from five stations between April 2013 and March 2014 from Bafa Lake. Sample were analyzed for water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, amonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and orthophosphate. From result surface water quality was assessed based on the comparison of samples collected near aquaculture stations. For reference, a sample was taken outside the cultivation area and compared with the Water Pollution Registration Act (WPRA) standards. According to the WPRA, surface water quality of the Lake was classified as level II. At the end of analyses, it was revealed that the area where aquaculture activities were intense showed high rate of polution than the other 3 stations as well as the reference station. The results show that, aquaculture activities on sea bream and sea bass have a negative impact in the entire Bafa Lake.

This study compared health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children allergic to wheat or grass. Methods: We surveyed 63 children with wheat allergies (median age of five) and 72 with grass allergies (median age 12), with their parents. The Child Health Questionnaires for parents (CHQ-PF28) and children (CHQ-CF87) were applied. Results: The parents of children in the wheat group recorded significantly lower CHQ-PF28 scores for the impact of their child's allergy on general behaviour, general health perceptions, parental impact of emotions and time and family activities, than the parents of children with grass allergies (p values <= 0.001). However, parents in the grass group recorded lower scores for the change in health item than the parents of children with wheat allergies (p = 0.020). In the grass group, children and parents reported similar scores for the different questions, but there was poorer correlation between parents and children in the wheat allergy group. Conclusion: HRQoL was lower in children with wheat than grass allergies according to parental reports, with more consistent perceptions of HRQoL among parents and children in the grass allergy than wheat allergy group.

To determine which specific groups of occupational stress factors influence the duration of temporary work disability related to arterial hypertension and joint complications/co-morbidities. Methodology. Workers (n=1398; 1009 in the exposed group, 389 in the control group) with arterial hypertension who worked at one workplace for a minimum of 10 years were divided into 10 subgroups, depending on the presence of joint complications/co-morbidities. The intensity of seven groups of occupational stress factors, the total score of Occupational Stress Index (OSI) and the average number of lost working days during 1 year were analysed. Results. The number of lost working days due to arterial hypertension and joint complications/co-morbidities was significantly higher in the exposed group. In all subgroups of the exposed group there was a high correlation between the number of lost working days and the total OSI score. Specific occupational stress factors were associated with specific complications: High Demands with chronic myocardial infarction, Strictness with cerebral haemorrhage, Conflict/Uncertainty with cerebral infarction, Extrinsic Time Pressure with acute myocardial infarction, and Avoidance/Symbolic Aversiveness with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

165,"As part of transmission network expansion planning (TNEP), a technical and economical assessment of several planning alternatives must be performed in order to ensure fulfillment of the network security criteria and to estimate the alternatives' expected operating costs. This task requires performing load flow calculations for different operating points (OPs) of the power system. Due to the high computational burden, considering all possible OPs is simply not possible. As a consequence, only a set of representative OPs is usually taken into account. Mostworks in the TNEP focus on issues related to optimization algorithms and modeling, neglecting the selection process of the representative OPs. Furthermore, most works only consider a few OPs, providing little or no insight about the criteria used in the selection process or about the error made when evaluating planning alternatives using a limited number of OPs. In this work, a novel methodology for selecting representative OPs to consider within the TNEP is presented. The proposal pays special attention to critical situations, where the network security may be endangered. Furthermore, the methodology allows quantifying the error made when evaluating network operation using a limited number of representative OPs.

166,"Assessment of the physical properties of agricultural and food products has always been of major importance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of estimating physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars using digital image processing and colorimetric measurements. Various characteristics of raw cane sugars such as ash, sucrose, invert sugar, solution color, pH, starch, dextran, moisture and refractive index of some Iranian and imported raw cane sugar samples were examined. Additionally, the images of samples were captured by a flat scanner, and different morphological characteristics such as area, perimeter, squareness and count number of crystal were determined using MATLAB software. In addition, the CIE color coordinates by a spectroradiometer with wavelength range of 380-780 nm were measured. Results demonstrated that there was a good correlation between certain morphological behaviors and some physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars. For example, some relationships between the area mean and dextran (r = 0.72), perimeter mean and dextran (r = 0.75) and squareness and starch (r = 0.76) were found. Moreover, correlations between certain physicochemical parameters such as ash, sucrose, invert sugar, solution color, dextran, pH and refractive index and some CIE color coordinates values such as L*, a*, b*, C*, h, X, Y, Z, x and y were indicated. Determining the physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars appears feasible using digital image analysis technique.

168,"Aim: To investigate the relationship between inflammatory markers and platelet size in generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). Material and Methods: Periodontal, inflammatory and platelet indices were compared between 59 GAgP patients and 59 healthy subjects. Gingival biopsies from five patients and five healthy subjects were examined by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Changes in patient periodontal and platelet indices were re-evaluated at 3 months after periodontal therapy. Results: Platelet size was decreased significantly in GAgP patients compared to healthy subjects (p <= 0.003). Weak negative correlations between platelet size and periodontal parameters were found in GAgP patients (p <= 0.025). Platelet aggregates and adhesion to the endothelium or leucocytes were found in venules and connective tissues of gingival biopsies from GAgP patients. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet large cell ratio increased after periodontal therapy in GAgP patients (p <= 0.038). The increase in MPV was related to the decrease in bleeding index in GAgP patients after periodontal therapy (p < 0.001; r = 0.357). Conclusion: Platelet size was reduced in GAgP patients compared to healthy controls, possibly due to the consumption of large platelets at sites of periodontal inflammation. Platelets may be involved in host responses to periodontal infection in GAgP.

169,"Based on the cellular automata model, a meticulous two-lane cellular automata model is proposed, in which the driving behavior difference and the difference of vehicles' accelerations between the moving state and the starting state are taken into account. Furthermore the vehicles' motion is refined by using the small cell of one meter long. Then accompanied by coming up with a traffic management measure, a two-lane highway traffic model containing a work zone is presented, in which the road is divided into normal area, merging area and work zone. The vehicles in different areas move forward according to different lane changing rules and position updating rules. After simulation it is found that when the density is small the cluster length in front of the work zone increases with the decrease of the merging probability. Then the suitable merging length and the appropriate speed limit value are recommended. The simulation result in the form of the speed-flow diagram is in good agreement with the empirical data. It indicates that the presented model is efficient and can partially reflect the real traffic. The results may be meaningful for traffic optimization and road construction management.

Recent developments in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have enabled non-invasive clarification of brain functions in psychiatric disorders. We prospectively evaluated brain activation in 20 chronic hepatitis C patients with or without IFN-based therapy by using NIRS during a verbal fluency task (VFT). MethodsThe relative concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin were measured while patients completed a questionnaire survey at the start of treatment and at 4 and 12weeks during treatment, using NIRS. ResultsThe VFT performance did not change among the two groups. Patients with IFN-based therapy showed significantly lower activation during VFT in frontal channels at 12weeks than those at the start of treatment and control (P<0.05). Their Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores were significantly higher at 12weeks than those at the start of treatment, although major depressive symptoms were not found (8.37.9 vs. 13.2 +/- 6.0, P<0.001). ConclusionThe decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations of the frontal lobe detected using NIRS in this study reflects hypofunction of the frontal lobe. This functional decline that was caused by IFN-based therapy may be associated with the prodromal phase of depression.

Therefore, a training program was designed considering physiological stress during a competition, in which the athlete would perform with a pad instead of a real opponent in order to prevent injury during preparatory competition. Methods. Twelve elite taekwondo players were selected (ages: 22 +/- 3 years, height: 178.66 +/- 6.58 cm, weight: 69.75 +/- 14.51 kg). VO2 (max) was measured using Bruce's exhaustive test (46.22 +/- 4.61 mL/min/kg). Then the anaerobic power was measured using RAST field method (9.8 +/- 1.08 W/kg). Heart rate (HR) alterations were determined using RPE10 Borog Scale before the competition, at three intervals periods between any round and at the end of the third round. Blood lactate concentration (LA) was evaluated before and after the competition. To evaluate the ratio of fighting to non-fighting activity, a digital video camera was used. During the simulation, taekwondo players performed motor skills simulating a competition with the pads. Change of blood lactate, HR and RPE were measured and compared with competition conditions (the opponents). Data were compared by one-way repeated-measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results. No significant differences were observed between the two conditions of competition and simulation training in HR, LA and RPE variables (P>0.05). Conclusion. Apparently the simulation training inflicts physiological stress on the elite athletes that may be replaced for preparatory competitions before a tournament to avoid possible sports injuries.

173,"As a basic method for monitoring the activities of Internet applications, traffic identification is very important for Internet management and security. Internet traffic data naturally exhibits imbalanced distributions, but this problem is rarely considered by the research community. Data gravitation-based classification (DGC) is a new classification model for handling imbalance data sets and we proposed an imbalanced DGC (IDGC) model in our previous study. In the present study, we developed an IDGC-based model to resolve imbalanced Internet traffic identification problems. First, we constructed six imbalanced traffic data sets from three original traffic data sets and we then extracted their early stage features according to the packet sizes. In identification experiments, we compared the performance of six standard algorithms, including DGC and four imbalanced algorithms with IDGC. The experimental results demonstrated that the standard classification models could achieve high accuracy with imbalanced traffic data, but their imbalanced performance was not as good, and their generalizability was also a problem. By contrast, IDGC performed very well and in a stable manner in terms of imbalanced performance measures, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness for imbalanced traffic identification.

Methods: Participants completed questionnaires and an online headache diary and migraine monitor following the International Classification of Headache Disorders at T0 (baseline), T1 (post-training), T2 (6-month follow-up; extended baseline in group 2), T3 (post-training, group 2 only) and T4 (group 1: 16-month follow-up; group 2: 6-month follow-up). Statistical analyses were conducted on the observed data without imputation of missing observations. Results: Both groups were highly comparable. The data over time revealed benefits in response to oBT, with significant between-group differences in the change achieved in the training episodes T2-T0 (group 1) and T4-T2 (group 2). Improved attack frequency (M = -23%) was higher in participants with more (i. e. 4-6) attacks per month at baseline, and the effects of oBT were durable over 16 months of follow-up.

178,"Based on the unit-cell concept, analytical solutions are presented to predict deformation behaviors of geotextile-encased stone columns at any depth below the top plane of the columns. Under vertical loads at the tops of the stone columns, an axial compression deformation occurs that is often accompanied by a lateral expansion near the top. This deformation characteristic of stone columns was incorporated directly into the proposed analytical method. The shear stress between the encased stone column and the surrounding soil in the vertical direction also was taken into account. In this method, the confining pressure provided by the soil was analyzed based on an analogy with passive earth pressure. The method was verified via comparison with two other analytical solutions. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effects of geotextile encasement, vertical applied stress, and column spacing and diameter on the deformation behaviors of columns. The results indicated that geotextile encasement with higher stiffness has a beneficial effect on reducing column bulging and settlement. Moreover, selection of geotextile stiffness for encased stone columns should be done in relation to column diameter and spacing because increased column diameter and decreased spacing have a great effect on settlement reduction.

Despite its economic importance, there is no soybean cultivar with durable ASR resistance. In addition, the P. pachyrhizi genome is not yet available. However, the availability of other rust genomes, as well as the development of sample enrichment strategies and bioinformatics tools, has improved our knowledge of the ASR secretome and its potential effectors. In this context, we used a combination of laser capture microdissection (LCM), RNAseq and a bioinformatics pipeline to identify a total of 36 350 P. pachyrhizi contigs expressed in planta and a predicted secretome of 851 proteins. Some of the predicted secreted proteins had characteristics of candidate effectors: small size, cysteine rich, do not contain PFAM domains (except those associated with pathogenicity) and strongly expressed in planta. A comparative analysis of the predicted secreted proteins present in Pucciniales species identified new members of soybean rust and new Pucciniales- or P. pachyrhizi-specific families (tribes). Members of some families were strongly up-regulated during early infection, starting with initial infection through haustorium formation. Effector candidates selected from two of these families were able to suppress immunity in transient assays, and were localized in the plant cytoplasm and nuclei. These experiments support our bioinformatics predictions and show that these families contain members that have functions consistent with P. pachyrhizi effectors.

182,"As GPUs become general purpose, they are outgrowing the co-processor model and require convenient I/O abstractions such as files and network sockets. Recent studies have shown the benefits of native GPU I/O layers, in terms of both programmability and performance. However, due to lack of hardware support, the GPU threads performing I/O calls are forced to busy-wait for the completion of I/O operations, resulting in underutilized hardware, higher power consumption, and reduced system throughput. We argue that I/O-driven preemption improves the performance of existing solutions, despite many challenging system characteristics such as a large kernel state. We analyze the benefits of adding preemption support using a simple system performance model, and, encouraged by the results, explore the design of a software-based preemption mechanism for GPUs. In our prototype, GPUpIO, we implement a source-to-source compiler for state checkpoint and restoration, and a runtime library for scheduling preempted thread-blocks, which together enable I/O-driven preemption for GPUs. We evaluate our prototype across a variety of system parameters and workloads to determine when preemption is worthwhile. We show that in some workloads the I/O-driven preemption approach may indeed double the effective system throughput by completely hiding the I/O latency behind computations. However, we also observe that the software-only solution is currently limited, not only due to its overheads, but also because it does not have sufficient control of the hardware scheduler queue and therefore may lead to starvation of I/O kernels. We then discuss a new hardware feature that, if added, may render a general I/O-driven preemption mechanism on GPUs practical.

Because of the limited reports describing the effect of irisin on inflammation and immunocompetent cells activation, the present study attempted to assess the influence of various irisin concentrations on basic macrophage activity. Main methods: Studies were carried out on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages cultured in medium enriched with irisin (0 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM, or 100 nM). General cell activity, viability, and proliferation were assessed along with phagocytosis process, and respiratory burst generation. Key finding: Irisin level positively correlates with general cell activity and cell cycle progression as well as with phagocytosis intensity, but negatively correlates with the intensity of respiratory burst generation. No influence of irisin on quiescent cell viability, including apoptosis or necrosis, was observed. Significance: This research is the first to show that irisin modulates macrophage activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, which could suggest its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, further studies are needed for the evaluation of influence of irisin on immunocompetent cell function. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

185,"Assessment of attack surface is a formidable challenge for the present-day dynamic networks. Essentially, attack surface (of a computer network) is a subset of network configuration and vulnerabilities that an adversary can use to compromise the target network in an incremental fashion. There are a large number of metrics available for network security risk assessment. However, they fail to measure temporal variation in the network attack surface. To overcome this problem, we propose graph distance metrics based on the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) and Graph Edit Distance (GED). In particular, we make use of classical graph distance metrics to quantify the distance between a pair of successive attack graphs generated for a dynamic network. Since the attack graph is capable of successfully capturing the attack surface of an underlying network, the distance between a pair of consecutive attack graphs (generated over the observed sampling interval) indicates the change in the network attack surface. To validate the efficacy and usability of graph distance metrics proposed in this study, we have tested 11 different metrics on a set of 3 different network models, viz., Flat, External-Internal, and DMZ. Experimental results show that MCS and GED based graph distance metrics successfully capture the temporal variation in the attack surface and also generate an alert about the security events which are responsible for the change. Using such graph distance metrics, we can pinpoint the events that cause a significant change in the network attack surface, locate most dangerous hosts in the network and the effect of increasing vulnerabilities further on these hosts. The advantage of using these metrics is that they scale polynomially with the graphs size and are independent of the graphs topology. It is also evident from the test results that the performance of MCS and GED based metrics is almost similar and hence the computation of one metric is enough to detect temporal variation in the network attack surface. The MCS and GED based graph distance metrics are oblivious to the AND semantic between the initial conditions in the attack graphs. Thus, there is a scope for improving their performance (sensitivity) by considering the AND semantic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

186,"Active control based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) methodology is applied to a candidate but realistic dual coaxial-cylinder wave-energy extractor system with the objective of maximizing energy capture over a range of incident ocean-wave conditions. The extractor consists of an outer cylinder (floater) moving relative to a tension-tethered inner cylinder, driving a permanent-magnet linear generator (PMLG) to acquire power take-off (PTO). The floater dynamics is solved in the time domain with the NMPC to constrain maximum floater motion and simultaneously incorporating the PMLG damping capability. The numerical model of the coupled floater and PTO dynamics is formulated in the state-space representation. The mechanical to electrical conversion efficiency of the PMLG, which was experimentally determined as a function of its power-extraction damping, is considered in the numerical simulation. The NMPC process yields a time-varying profile for the generator damping as the control strategy. Simulation results indicate strongly time-dependent and discontinuous generator-damping requirements for both regular and irregular incident-wave scenarios. However, the NMPC-controlled system significantly outperforms a passive-control, constant-damping system by exhibiting higher peak values of energy-extraction and a broader capturing bandwidth, thus confirming the feasibility and success of the control strategy.

In this paper, the electromagnetic force is acquired from the displacement measured by the strain gauge. By using the switched reluctance motor which has salient poles, the displacements on both the stator and the rotor are measured. Additionally, the frequency characteristics of the sensor and waveforms at driving condition are measured and discussed. The measured results are compared with the simulation results. Thus, the effectiveness of the proposed method is examined. The proposed method is effective to acquire the instantaneous torque and radial electromagnetic force, this study enable to vibration and torque ripple reduction.

192,"As one of the most classic fields in computer vision, image categorization has attracted widespread interests. Numerous algorithms have been proposed in the community, and many of them have advanced the state-of-the-art. However, most existing algorithms are designed without consideration for the supply of computing resources. Therefore, when dealing with resource constrained tasks, these algorithms will fail to give satisfactory results. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and in-depth introduction of recent developments of the research in image categorization with resource constraints. While a large portion is based on our own work, we will also give a brief description of other elegant algorithms. Furthermore, we make an investigation into the recent developments of deep neural networks, with a focus on resource constrained deep nets.

Also, excess of mean-square error and misadjustment analysis of the RSOR algorithm is presented. These results are verified by ensemble-averaged computer simulations. Furthermore, the performance of the RSOR algorithm is examined using a system identification example and compared with other widely used adaptive algorithms. Computer simulations show that the RSOR algorithm has better convergence rate than the widely used gradient-based algorithms and gives comparable results obtained by the recursive least-squares RLS algorithm.

194,"As networks applications are growing fast, data are more generated and transmitted, leaving it vulnerable to modification. Besides that, the significance, sensitivity and preciseness of that information cause a big security issue, increasing the needs to keep it safe. One proper solution for this problem is cryptography, which is a technique used to transform data to unrecognizable information and useless to any unauthorized person. By being the main core of network security and since new attacks techniques are daily invented, ciphers are constantly under test by cryptanalysis attacks to harden their safety. This paper contains a fair comparison between serval ciphers in speed test under different platforms, also in performance and risk to globalize the vision about the most fast safe algorithm.

195,"Assessing the quality of aperture synthesis maps is relevant for benchmarking image reconstruction algorithms, for the scientific exploitation of data from optical long-baseline interferometers, and for the design/upgrade of new/existing interferometric imaging facilities. Although metrics have been proposed in these contexts, no systematic study has been conducted on the selection of a robust metric for quality assessment. This article addresses the question: what is the best metric to assess the quality of a reconstructed image? It starts by considering several metrics and selecting a few based on general properties. Then, a variety of image reconstruction cases are considered. The observational scenarios are phase closure and phase referencing at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), for a combination of two, three, four and six telescopes. End-to-end image reconstruction is accomplished with the MIRA software, and several merit functions are put to test. It is found that convolution by an effective point spread function is required for proper image quality assessment. The effective angular resolution of the images is superior to naive expectation based on the maximum frequency sampled by the array. This is due to the prior information used in the aperture synthesis algorithm and to the nature of the objects considered. The l(1)-norm is the most robust of all considered metrics, because being linear it is less sensitive to image smoothing by high regularization levels. For the cases considered, this metric allows the implementation of automatic quality assessment of reconstructed images, with a performance similar to human selection.

196,"Aims and objectives To assess women's attitudes towards the mechanisms of action of birth control methods. BackgroundWhen addressing women's knowledge of and attitudes towards birth control methods, researchers frequently focus on side effects, effectiveness or correct use. Women's opinions about mechanisms of action have been much less investigated, and research is usually concentrated on the EC pill. DesignCross-sectional study. MethodsWomen, aged 18-49, from Germany, France, the UK, Sweden and Romania were randomly selected (n=1137). They were asked whether they would use a method that may work after fertilisation or after implantation and whether they would continue using it after learning it may have such effects. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the influence of certain characteristics on women's attitudes. ResultsAlmost half of women in Romania and Germany would not use methods with postfertilisation effects, while the lowest percentages were found in Sweden and in France. Regarding methods with postimplantation effects, higher percentages were found in all the countries. Highly educated women and those using a highly effective method were more likely to use methods with postfertilisation effects. On the contrary, married women, those who stated that human life begins at fertilisation and women with middle/high religiosity were less likely to consider using methods that may act after fertilisation. Conclusions One-third of European women reported that they would not consider using a method that may have postfertilisation effects. Relevance to clinical practice Given that postfertilisation effects may not be acceptable to some women, informing them of which methods may have these effects is essential to obtaining complete informed consent and to promoting women's autonomy.

This often makes its working performance become worse. Therefore, a self-tuning fuzzy PID controller is used for pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat to decrease this influence. A simplified three degrees of freedom mathematical model of seat-vehicle body-crawler chassis is established. The vibration damping characteristics of the pneumatic artificial muscle seat are obtained using Matlab/Simulink toolbox. Under four different working conditions of crawler construction vehicle, vertical accelerations and displacements are compared between the new pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat and traditional seat. The simulation results show that the pneumatic artificial muscle seat could get better damping properties. To verify the analytical model, experiments were performed on C and G roads. The simulation results show reasonably good agreements with the experimental data. These research results could provide references for further development of pneumatic artificial muscle-type damping seat.

199,"Africa's population is growing at a faster pace, and the growth in megacities and rate of urbanization has been very rapid. Alongside, economic growth is expected to be very robust in the future. Altogether, these will pose serious challenges for the energy system in Africa; a condition that makes the development of renewables (RES) a necessity in the continent. Though the continent is well-endowed with RES, it is least developed and deployed, partly due to limited research and development in the sector. Particularly, the macroeconomic implications of RES have not been thoroughly studied in the continent, which leaves a big literature gap for the continent. This motivates the current study to investigate into the macroeconomic implications of RES using Ghana as the case study, a country that is Well-endowed with RES and one of the few in the continent that has integrated RES into their overall energy policy. Specifically, in this study, we examined the implications of RES concentration on electricity price uncertainty. Further, we investigated the persistent profile effect of both system-wide and individual shocks on the equilibrium relations. Finally, we decomposed the variance in electricity price into permanent and transitory components and explained what drives these trends. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a parallel algorithm based on a two-level, Schur-complement-based, domain decomposition method. The two-level partitioning provides high parallelization potential (coarse- and fine-grained). In addition, due to the Schur-complement approach used to update the sub-domain interface variables, the algorithm exhibits high global convergence rate. Finally, it provides significant numerical and computational acceleration. The algorithm is implemented using the shared-memory parallel programming model, targeting inexpensive multi-core machines. Its performance is reported on a real system as well as on a large test system combining transmission and distribution networks.

202,"As location-aware applications and location-based services continue to increase in popularity, data sources describing a range of dynamic processes occurring in near real-time over multiple spatial and temporal scales are becoming the norm. At the same time, existing frameworks useful for understanding these dynamic spatio-temporal data, such as time geography, are unable to scale to the high volume, velocity, and variety of these emerging data sources. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that turns time geography into a scalable analysis tool that can handle large and rapidly changing datasets. The Hierarchical Prism Tree (HPT) is a dynamic data structure for fast queries on spatio-temporal objects based on time geographic principles and theories, which takes advantage of recent advances in moving object databases and computer graphics. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed HPT using two common time geography tasks (finding similar trajectories and mapping potential space-time interactions), taking advantage of open data on space-time vehicle emissions from the EnviroCar platform.

203,"Bilinear oscillator is a spring-mass system with the spring having different stiffnesses in tension and compression. We analyze the behavior of the bilinear oscillator under a constant preload assuming that the spring has lower stiffness in tension than in compression. We formulate the conditions of the existence of the asymptotics of low stiffness ratios. Under these conditions, the bilinear oscillator can be approximated by an impact oscillator (an oscillator with zero stiffness ratio) under the same preload. In this asymptotics the damping of the stiff (compressive) part is modeled by the introduction of a restitution coefficient. We found that the use of the impact oscillator as an asymptotics of low stiffness ratios is only possible for sufficiently small preloads. We also determined the values of the restitution coefficient that simulate the given damping in the high stiffness region. The relation between the damping and the restitution coefficient is found to be independent of the magnitude of the preload. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

204,"Active demand side response (DSR) will provide a significant opportunity to enhance the power system flexibility in the Great Britain (GB). Although electricity peak shaving has a clear reduction on required investments in the power system, the benefits on the gas supply network have not been examined. Using a Combined Gas and Electricity Networks expansion model (CGEN+), the impact of DSR on the electricity and gas supply systems in GB was investigated for the time horizon from 2010 to 2050s. The results showed a significant reduction in the capacity of new gas-fired power plants, caused by electricity peak shaving. The reduction of gas-fired power plants achieved through DSR consequently reduced the requirements for gas import capacity up to 90 million cubic meter per day by 2050. The cost savings resulted from the deployment of DSR over a 50-year time horizon from 2010 was estimated to be around 60 billion for the GB power system. Although, the cost saving achieved in the gas network was not significant, it was shown that the DSR will have a crucial role to play in the improvement of security of gas supply.

205,"As motion sensors are getting light-weighted and low-priced, there is a growing appetite for the accelerometer-based approaches for efficiently monitoring human activities. This paper proposes an original feature selection approach based on the spectral distances between a given signal and an activity model. This new technique is evaluated and compared to existing techniques in literature. This study also investigates the improvement of classification performances brought by the heart rate (HR) data in addition to the accelerometer data. The experimental dataset is composed of both acceleration and HR recordings from eight volunteers performing five ambulation activities. Four wearable sensor units, including an ECG node are employed. The response of the system to three widely used classifiers, the K-nearest neighbors K-NN, the Naive Bayes NB and the decision Tree C4.5 is reported along with the classification rates. The results reached up to 99% of overall recognition accuracy and higher than 98% using a single-sensor acceleration data and the HR data. These results demonstrate that the spectral distances approach can be adopted to accurately classify activities and that the joint processing of acceleration signals together with the HR signals can increase the classification accuracy compared to the case when processing the acceleration signals alone.

210,"As networking has become major innovation driver for the Internet of Things as well as Networks on Chips, the need for effective cryptography in hardware is on a steep rise. Both cost and overall system security are the main challenges in many application scenarios, rather than high throughput. In this work we present area-optimized implementations of the lightweight block cipher SIMON. All presented cores are protected against side channel attacks using threshold implementation, which applies secret sharing of different orders to prevent exploitable leakages. Implementation results show that, on FPGAs, the higher-order protected SIMON core can be smaller than an unprotected AES core at the same security level against classic cryptanalysis. Also, the proposed secure cores consume less than 30 percent the power of any unprotected AES. Security of the proposed cores is validated by provable arguments as well as practical t-test based leakage detection methods. In fact, we show that the first-order protected SIMON core does not have first-order leakage and is secure up to 10 million observations against higher-order attacks. The second-order secure implementation could not be exploited at all with up to 100 million observations.

211,"Aim: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors are a common treatment strategy for metastatic melanoma and other tumour entities. Clinical trials usually exclude patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases, thus experience with PD-1 inhibitor (PD-li) in this patient population is limited. Patients and methods: Metastatic melanoma patients with preexisting autoimmune disorders or previous ipilimumab-triggered immune-related adverse events (irAE) undergoing treatment with PD-li from seven German skin cancer centres were evaluated retrospectively with regard to flare of the preexisting autoimmunity and development of new, not preexisting irAE as well as response to PD-li therapy. Results: In total, 41 patients had either preexisting autoimmunity (n = 19, group A, including two patients with additional ipilimumab-triggered autoimmune colitis) or ipilimumab-triggered irAE (n = 22, group B). At PD-li therapy initiation, six patients in group A and two patients in group B required immunosuppressive therapy. In group A, a flare of preexisting autoimmune disorders was seen in 42% of patients, new irAE in 16%. In group B, 4.5% of patients showed a flare of ipilimumab-triggered irAE and 23% new irAE. All flares of preexisting autoimmune disorders or irAE were managed by immunosuppressive and/or symptomatic therapy and did not require termination of PD-li therapy. tumour responses (32% in group A and 45% in group B) were unrelated to occurrence of autoimmunity. Conclusion: While preexisting autoimmunity commonly showed a flare during PD-li therapy, a flare of ipilimumab-triggered irAE was rare. Response rates were above 30% and unrelated to irAE. PD-li therapy can be considered in patients with autoimmune disorders depending on severity and activity of autoimmunity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In spring 2000, the bridge underwent a major retrofit using visco-elastic dampers. This study focuses on seismic vulnerability of the retrofitted bridge. Three-dimensional memberbased detailed and panel-based simplified finite element models of the bridge are developed. In order to show the appropriateness of these models, eigenproperties of the bridge are evaluated and compared with the system identification results obtained using ambient vibration data. In addition, a model validation is performed by simulating the dynamic response during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and comparing with the measured response. Finally, considering a set of strong ground motions in the Los Angeles area, nonlinear time history analyses are performed and the ductility demands of critical sections are presented in terms of fragility curves. The study shows that a ground motion with peak ground acceleration of 0.9 g or greater will result in plastic hinge formation at one or more locations with a probability of exceedance of 50%. Also, it is found that the effect of dampers is minimal for low to moderate earthquakes and high for strong earthquakes.

Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum.

Methods: Current drinkers in Canada (n=565) recruited through zoompanel were asked about 13 past year hangover symptoms. These were explored through correlation with alcohol consumption, problems, treatment and other factors. Findings: Increased number of symptoms were associated with higher Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) problem score, perceived harm from drinking, younger age and flushing/blushing when drinking (Mean = 3.3 symptoms). Four patterns were found from latent class analysis; class 4 (43%) no symptoms; class 3 (13%) thirst, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting; class 2 (22%) thirst, tiredness and headache; and class 1 (21%) wide range. Class 1 was characterised by blushing when drinking, higher perceived harm and attempts to reduce drinking due to hangovers. Classes 1-3 were associated with heavier consumption; only class 3 compared with class 4 had lower drinking refusal self-efficacy. Conclusions: higher alcohol consumption and lower drinking refusal self-efficacy relate to more symptoms; however, a group with variable alcohol consumption did not experience hangovers.

Disability measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), the relative Constant-Murley score (CMS) and the shortened version of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (ShortWORC). The relationship between predictors and reparability was examined through logistic regressions and chi-square statistics as appropriate. Within group change over time and between group differences in disability outcomes, range of motion and strength were examined by student's T-tests and non-parametric statistics. Results: One hundred and twenty two patients (41 women, 81 men, mean age 64, SD = 9) were included in the analysis. There were 86 large (39 fully reparable, 47 partially reparable) and 36 (10 fully reparable, 26 partially reparable) massive tears. Reparability was not associated with age, sex, or pre-operative active flexion or abduction (p >0.05) but the fully reparable tear group showed a better pre-operative ASES score (p = 0.01) and better active external rotation in neutral (p = 0.01). Reparability was associated with tear shape (p < 0.0001), size (p = 0.002), and tendon quality (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Reparability of large or massive tears is affected by a number of clinical and surgical factors. Patients whose tears could not be fully repaired showed a statistically significant improvement in range of motion, strength and disability at 2 years, although they had slightly inferior results compared to those with complete repairs.

225,"AIM To prospectively evaluate the postoperative morbimortality and weight loss evolution of patients who underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a primary bariatric procedure during 5 years of follow-up. METHODS Since 2006, data from patients undergoing a highly restrictive primary LSG have been prospectively registered in a database and analysed. Preoperative co-morbid conditions, operating time, hospital stay, early and late complications rate and evolution of weight loss after 5 years of follow-up were analysed. RESULTS A total of 156 patients were included, 74.3% of whom were women. The mean age was 43.2 +/- 13.1 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 41.5 +/- 7.9 kg/m(2). Seventy patients (44.8%) presented a BMI under 40 kg/m(2). The mortality rate was 0%. The leakage rate was 1.2%, and the total 30-d morbidity rate was 5.1% (8/156). With a mean follow-up of 32.7 +/- 28.5 (range 6-112) mo, the mean percent of excess of weight loss (% EWL) was 82.0 +/- 18.8 at 1 year, 76.7 +/- 21.3 at 3 years and 60.3 +/- 28.9 at 5 years. The mean percent of excess of BMI loss (% EBMIL) was 94.9 +/- 22.4 at 1 year, 89.4 +/- 27.4 at 3 years and 74.8 +/- 29.4 at 5 years. Patients with preoperative BMI less than 40 kg/m(2) achieved greater weight loss than did the overall study population. Diabetes remitted in 75% of the patients and HTA improved in 71.7%. CPAP masks were withdrawn in all patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. CONCLUSION LSG built with a narrow 34 F bougie and starting 3 cm from the pylorus proved to be safe and highly effective in terms of weight loss as a stand-alone procedure, particularly in patients with a preoperative BMI lower than 40 kg/m(2).

226,"Apply machine learning principles to predict hip fractures and estimate predictor importance in Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-scanned men and women. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry data from two Danish regions between 1996 and 2006 were combined with national Danish patient data to comprise 4722 women and 717 men with 5 years of follow-up time (original cohort n = 6606 men and women). Twenty-four statistical models were built on 75% of data points through k-5, 5-repeat cross-validation, and then validated on the remaining 25% of data points to calculate area under the curve (AUC) and calibrate probability estimates. The best models were retrained with restricted predictor subsets to estimate the best subsets. For women, bootstrap aggregated flexible discriminant analysis (""bagFDA"") performed best with a test AUC of 0.92 [0.89; 0.94] and well-calibrated probabilities following Na < ve Bayes adjustments. A ""bagFDA"" model limited to 11 predictors (among them bone mineral densities (BMD), biochemical glucose measurements, general practitioner and dentist use) achieved a test AUC of 0.91 [0.88; 0.93]. For men, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (""xgbTree"") performed best with a test AUC of 0.89 [0.82; 0.95], but with poor calibration in higher probabilities. A ten predictor subset (BMD, biochemical cholesterol and liver function tests, penicillin use and osteoarthritis diagnoses) achieved a test AUC of 0.86 [0.78; 0.94] using an ""xgbTree"" model. Machine learning can improve hip fracture prediction beyond logistic regression using ensemble models. Compiling data from international cohorts of longer follow-up and performing similar machine learning procedures has the potential to further improve discrimination and calibration.

227,"Background: Green building systems have proliferated but health outcomes and associated costs and benefits remain poorly understood. Objective: To compare health before and after families moved into new green healthy housing with a control group in traditionally repaired housing. Design and Setting: Mixed methods study in 3 Chicago housing developments. Participants: Public housing and low-income subsidized households (n = 325 apartments with 803 individuals). Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported health status, visual assessment of housing condition, indoor air sampling, and Medicaid expenditure and diagnostic data. Medicaid expenditures and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were modeled using a generalized linear model with. distribution and log-link. Results: Housing conditions and self-reported physical and mental health improved significantly in the green healthy housing study group compared with both the control group and the dilapidated public housing from which the residents moved, as did hay fever, headaches, sinusitis, angina, and respiratory allergy. Asthma severity measured by self-reported lost school/work days, disturbed sleep, and symptoms improved significantly, as did sadness, nervousness, restlessness, and child behavior. Medicaid data in this exploratory study were inconclusive and inconsistent with self-reported health outcomes and visual assessment data on housing quality but hold promise for future investigation. Possible sources of bias in the Medicaid data include older age in the study group, changes in Medicaid eligibility over time, controlling for Medicaid costs in an urban area, and the increased stress associated with moving, even if the move is into better housing. Conclusion: The mixed method approach employed here describes the complex relationships among self-reported health, housing conditions, environmental measures, and clinical data. Housing conditions and self-reported physical and mental health improved in green healthy housing. Health care cost savings in Medicaid due to improved housing could not be quantified here but hold promise for future investigations with larger cohorts over a longer follow-up period.

228,"Based on the experimental data from a scaled model of the Liede Bridge in Guangzhou, China, the nonlinear behavior of a self-anchored suspension bridge during the process of structural system transformation has been systematically and comprehensively studied. The variation of main cable deformation, hanger tension, and main girder stress during the transformation process is analyzed, and their relationships with the different states of structural system are studied. The characteristics and distribution patterns of the lateral torsional angle of spatial cable clamps are identified. In this paper, the principles of the two stages of construction control for self-anchored suspension bridges are introduced, and construction control targets and error elimination methods for each stage are also discussed. Based on the measured results of an in situ static load test, the response characteristics of main cable axial deformation, hanger tension, and deflection stress of the main girder are described under the most unfavorable unbalanced loading case. The effects induced by the secondary dead and live load are obtained by a linear analysis procedure according to the accumulative theory. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

229,"Aim: The aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the Salutogenic Health Indicator Scale (SHIS) in an adolescent population. Methods: The investigation was performed among Swedish students aged 13-15 years (n = 817; 58% girls). The SHIS was assessed for respondent acceptability, and its psychometric properties were evaluated according to classical test theory (regarding unidimensionality, targeting, reliability, and external construct validity). Results: The adolescents found it easy to complete the questionnaire, which was completed in an average of 4 minutes. Exploratory factor analysis, which is based on polychoric correlations, identified one factor, supporting the instrument's unidimensionality. Floor/ceiling effects were 3.3%. Reliability estimates yielded a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.93; the test-retest reliability (n = 50; 2-week interval) coefficients were 0.89 for the total SHIS score and 0.52-0.79 for item scores. Spearman correlations with other variables were based on a priori expectations (self-rated general health, 0.595; depressive symptoms, -0.773; anxiety, -0.577; and sleep problems, 0.519). Conclusions: Our observations support both the acceptability and the psychometric properties of the SHIS as a brief, unidimensional assessment tool for salutogenic health in adolescents. Further studies using modern test theory are needed to better understand the measurement properties of the SHIS, including the functioning of its response categories and its comparability between adolescents and adults.

230,"Aim: Parent-reporting is needed to examine Quality of Life (QoL) of children with cerebral palsy (CP) across all severities. This study examines whether QoL changes between childhood and adolescence, and what predicts adolescent QoL. Method: SPARCLE is a European cohort study of children with CP, randomly sampled from population databases. Of 818 8-12-year-olds joining the study, 594 (73%) were revisited as 13-17-year-olds. The subject of this report is the 551 (316 boys, 235 girls) where. the same parent reported QoL on both occasions using KIDSCREEN-52 (transformed Rasch scale, mean 50, SD 10 per domain). Associations were assessed using linear regression. Results: Between childhood and adolescence, average QoL reduced in six domains (1.3-3.8 points, p <0.01) and was stable in three (Physical wellbeing, Autonomy, Social acceptance). Socio-demographic factors had little predictive value. Childhood QoL was a strong predictor of all domains of adolescent QoL. Severe impairments of motor function, IQ or communication predicted higher adolescent QoL on some domains; except that severe motor impairment predicted lower adolescent QoL on the Autonomy domain. More psychological problems and higher parenting stress in childhood and their worsening by adolescence predicted lower QoL in five and eight domains respectively; contemporaneous pain in seven domains. The final model explained 30%-40% of variance in QoL, depending on domain. Interpretation: In general, impairment severity and socio-demographic factors were not predictors of lower adolescent QoL. However, pain, psychological problems and parenting stress were predictors of lower adolescent QoL in most domains. These are modifiable factors and addressing them may improve adolescent QoL.

231,"Based on fuzzy decision theory, multi objective fuzzy optimization is done for the dynamic isolation model scheme of self-anchored cable-stayed suspension bridge. Using two comparison theory solves the problem of quantifying the qualitative indexes and distinguish the concepts of importance and superiority. Combining the fuzzy decision method with engineering practice and using the results of five cases are proposed for multi objective fuzzy optimization. Comparison results show that it is more reasonable to place lead rubber bearings not only between pier and girder, but also main tower and girder, with viscous dampers between main tower and girder on the same time. This method can provide a reference for structure selection in practical conceptual design phase.

233,"Aims and objectives. To explore emergency nurses' perceptions of the feasibility and utility of Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia tool in people over 65 with cognitive impairment. The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia tool was then compared with The Abbey Pain Scale, Doloplus-2 and PACSLAC. The objective was to determine which observational pain assessment tool was the most appropriate for the emergency department context and the cognitively impaired older person. Background. The number of older people with cognitive impairment conditions, such as dementia, presenting to the emergency department is increasing. Approximately 28% of people over 65 years who present will have cognitive impairment. Older people with cognitive impairment often receive suboptimal pain management in the ED. There is limited evidence of the use and/or appropriateness of dementia-specific pain observation assessment tools in the ED. Design. This was a multicentre exploratory qualitative study, which was conducted within a constructivist paradigm. Methods. Focus group interviews were conducted with nurses across three hospital emergency departments. Data were subject to thematic analysis. Results. Six focus groups were conducted with 36 nurses over a 12-week period. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1) cognitive impairment is a barrier to pain management; 2) PAINAD gives structure to pain assessment; 3) PAINAD assists to convey pain intensity; and 4) selection of an appropriate observational pain assessment tool. Conclusions. This study identified that emergency nurses find it challenging to detect, assess and manage pain in cognitively impaired people. While the use of the PAINAD helped to address these challenges compared to other tools, nurses also identified the important role that family and carers can play in pain assessment and management for older people with cognitive impairment. Relevance to clinical practice. This study has generated new knowledge that has broad application across clinical settings, which can assist to transform pain management practice and reduce human suffering. The use of an observational pain assessment tool can provide for greater practice consistency for patients with communication difficulties. Pain management for older people with cognitive impairment is best achieved by the use an appropriate observational pain assessment tool and with a multidisciplinary approach that includes the person and their family/carer.

234,"Background: Legionella spp. employ multiple strategies to adapt to stressful environments including the proliferation in protective biofilms and the ability to form associations with free-living amoeba (FLA). The aim of the current study was to identify Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., Vermamoeba (Hartmannella) vermiformis and Naegleria fowleri that persist in a harvested rainwater and solar pasteurization treatment system. Methods: Pasteurized (45 degrees C, 65 degrees C, 68 degrees C, 74 degrees C, 84 degrees C and 93 degrees C) and unpasteurized tank water samples were screened for Legionella spp. and the heterotrophic plate count was enumerated. Additionally, ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR) was utilized for the quantification of viable Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., V. vermiformis and N. fowleri in pasteurized (68 degrees C, 74 degrees C, 84 degrees C and 93 degrees C) and unpasteurized tank water samples, respectively. Results: Of the 82 Legionella spp. isolated from unpasteurized tank water samples, Legionella longbeachae (35 %) was the most frequently isolated, followed by Legionella norrlandica (27 %) and Legionella rowbothamii (4 %). Additionally, a positive correlation was recorded between the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. detected (rho = 0.710, P = 0.048) and the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. isolated (rho = 0.779, P = 0.0028) from the tank water samples collected. Solar pasteurization was effective in reducing the gene copies of viable V. vermiformis (3-log) and N. fowleri (5-log) to below the lower limit of detection at temperatures of 68-93 degrees C and 74-93 degrees C, respectively. Conversely, while the gene copies of viable Legionella and Acanthamoeba were significantly reduced by 2-logs (P = 0.0024) and 1-log (P = 0.0015) overall, respectively, both organisms were still detected after pasteurization at 93 degrees C. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that Acanthamoeba spp. primarily acts as the vector and aids in the survival of Legionella spp. in the solar pasteurized rainwater as both organisms were detected and were viable at high temperatures (68-93 degrees C).

235,"As the demand for textile products and synthetic dyes increases with the growing global population, textile dye wastewater is becoming one of the most significant water pollution contributors. Azo dyes represent 70% of dyes used worldwide, and are hence a significant contributor to textile waste. In this work, the removal of a reactive azo dye (Reactive Orange 16) from water by adsorption with chitosan grafted poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (CTS-GMA-g-PPEGMA) was investigated. The chitosan (CTS) was first functionalized with glycidyl methacrylate and then grafted with poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) using a nitroxide-mediated polymerization grafting to approach. Equilibrium adsorption experiments were carried out at different initial dye concentrations and were successfully fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. Adsorption isotherms showed maximum adsorption capacities of CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA and chitosan of 200 mg/g and 150 mg/g, respectively, while the Langmuir equations estimated 232 mg/g and 194 mg/g, respectively. The fundamental assumptions underlying the Langmuir model may not be applicable for azo dye adsorption, which could explain the difference. The Freundlich isotherm parameters, n and K, were determined to be 2.18 and 17.7 for CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA and 0.14 and 2.11 for chitosan, respectively. An n value between one and ten generally indicates favorable adsorption. The adsorption capacities of a chitosan-PPEGMA 50/50 physical mixture and pure PPEGMA were also investigated, and both exhibited significantly lower adsorption capacities than pure chitosan. In this work, CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA proved to be more effective than its parent chitosan, with a 33% increase in adsorption capacity.

Wave filters simulate topologically And functionally passive double terminated LC ladder prototype filters of low sensitivity. The design in the log-domain is based on a transposition of the signal flow graph (SFG) that corresponds to the wave equivalent of elementary two-port blocks in the linear domain, to the corresponding log-domain SFG. This is achieved by using an appropriate set of complementary operators, in order to preserve the linear operation of the whole circuit. Simulation results of a fifth-order low-pass and a fourth-order bandpass log-domain wave filter are given, using HSPICE. The proposed circuits are suitable for low-voltage operation and in high-frequency applications.

To this extent, this paper investigates the experimental performance of Snort-based NIDS (S-NIDS) in a practical network with the latest technology in various network scenarios including high data speed and/or heavy traffic and/or large packet size. An effective testbed is designed based on Snort using different muti-core processors, e.g., i5 and i7, with different operating systems, e.g., Windows 7, Windows Server and Linux. Furthermore, considering an enterprise network consisting of multiple virtual local area networks (VLANs), a centralised parallel S-NIDS (CPS-NIDS) is proposed with the support of a centralised database server to deal with high data speed and heavy traffic. Experimental evaluation is carried out for each network configuration to evaluate the performance of the S-NIDS in different network scenarios as well as validating the effectiveness of the proposed CPS-NIDS. In particular, by analysing packet analysis efficiency, an improved performance of up to 10% is shown to be achieved with Linux over other operating systems, while up to 8% of improved performance can be achieved with i7 over i5 processors.

The hydrogel was prepared by graft copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) onto sodium alginate (SA) biopolymer in the presence of a crosslinking agent, a free radical initiator and TiO2 nanoparticles. The hydrogel exhibited a high swelling capacity of 412.98 g/g. The factors influencing adsorption capacity of the absorbents such as pH of the dye solutions, initial concentration of the dye, amount of absorbents, and temperature were investigated and used to propose a possible mechanism of adsorption. The adsorption process concurs with a pseudo-second-order kinetics and with Langmuir isotherm equation. A very high adsorption capacity (Q(max) = 2257.36 (mg/g)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.998 calculated from isotherm equations show the high efficiency of the absorbent and thus expected to be a good candidate as an absorbent for water treatment.

Biodiversity mapping can benefit from multi-spectral instruments such as WorldView-2 with very high spatial resolution and a spectral configuration encompassing important spectral regions not previously available for vegetation mapping. This study investigated i) the benefits of the eight-band WorldView-2 (WV-2) spectral configuration for discriminating tree species in Southern African savannah and ii) if multiple-images acquired at key points of the typical phenological development of savannahs (peak productivity, transition to senescence) improve on tree species classifications. We first assessed the discriminatory power of WV-2 bands using interspecies-Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) via Band Add-On procedure and tested the spectral capability of WorldView-2 against simulated IKONOS for tree species classification. The results from interspecies-SAM procedure identified the yellow and red bands as the most statistically significant bands (p = 0.000251 and p = 0.000039 respectively) in the discriminatory power of WV-2 during the transition from wet to dry season (April). Using Random Forest classifier, the classification scenarios investigated showed that i) the 8-bands of the WV-2 sensor achieved higher classification accuracy for the April date (transition from wet to dry season, senescence) compared to the March date (peak productivity season) ii) the WV-2 spectral configuration systematically outperformed the IKONOS sensor spectral configuration and iii) the multi-temporal approach (March and April combined) improved the discrimination of tress species and produced the highest overall accuracy results at 80.4%. Consistent with the interspecies-SAM procedure, the yellow (605 nm) band also showed a statistically significant contribution in the improved classification accuracy from WV-2. These results highlight the mapping opportunities presented by WV-2 data for monitoring the distribution status of e.g. species often harvested by local communities (e.g. Sclerocharya birrea), encroaching species, or species-specific tree losses induced by elephants.

245,"Aims and objectives. To describe perceived social support among patients with coronary heart disease following percutaneous coronary intervention. Background. A low level of social support is considered a risk factor for coronary heart disease in healthy individuals and reduces the likelihood that people diagnosed with coronary heart disease will have a good prognosis. Design. A descriptive cross-sectional study. Methods. A survey of 416 patients was conducted in 2013. A self-report instrument, Social Support of People with Coronary Heart Disease, was used. The instrument comprises three dimensions of social support: informational, emotional, functional supports and 16 background variables. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, mean sum variables and multivariate logistic regression. Results. Perceived informational support was primarily high, but respondents' risk factors were not at the target level. The weakest items of informational support were advice on physical activity, continuum of care and rehabilitation. Regarding the items of emotional support, support from other cardiac patients was the weakest. The weakest item of functional support was respondents' sense of the healthcare professionals' care of patients coping with their disease. Background variables associated with perceived social support were gender, marital status, level of formal education, profession, physical activity, duration of coronary heart disease and previous myocardial infarction. Conclusions. Healthcare professionals should pay extra attention to women, single patients, physically inactive patients, those demonstrating a lower level of education, those with a longer duration of CHD, and respondents without previous acute myocardial infarction. Continuum of care and counselling are important to ensure especially among them. Relevance to clinical practice. This study provides evidence that healthcare professionals should be more aware of the individual needs for social support among patients with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods: Patients were randomised to H-CR or SC-CR after admission for acute coronary syndrome. In SC-CR, the general practitioner took over the responsibility of the remaining rehabilitation, pharmacological treatment and risk factor management after the initial visit to the hospital outpatient clinic. The Municipal Health Care Centres provided courses on smoking cessation, nutrition, and exercise training and contributed to disease education and psychosocial support. The main endpoint was adherence to the CR programme and compliance with lifestyle modifications. Results: In total, 1364 patients were screened, 327 (24%) were eligible, and 212 (65%) accepted participation. Phase II CR was completed by 192 (91%) of the participants. Full adherence to the CR programme was seen in 53% in SC-CR versus 54% in H-CR (relative risk (RR): 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.32). In H-CR, patients had higher rates of adherence to dietary advice and health education. In SC-CR, 12% of patients did not attend the risk factor evaluation and clinical assessment with their general practitioner. No difference in risk factor improvement was found. Exercise training was declined by 25% in both groups. Conclusion: Adherence to phase II CR was high in both groups. SC-CR did not improve adherence and efficacy, but had comparable effects on medication and risk factors. Thus, SC-CR was safe and effective.

The proposed modeling methodology is validated by applying to SC integrators implemented by two different operational amplifiers. The step response waveforms of the integrator model have good agreement to the transistor-level simulation results with a speedup of about 20x.

248,"Because of the reducing number of satellite images with various periods and good quality caused not only by changes in climate conditions, but also typhoons, rainy seasons, and various atmospheric changes, continuous image production and identification of changes in biophysical characteristics have become increasingly difficult. To remedy this, the production of simulated image that consider user-preferred periods and satellite geometric information can be one of alternatives. In this study, a simulated image generation method that uses the back project under collinearity conditions and atmospheric simulation is proposed. To create input data for the generation of simulated image, we produced SPOT-4 HRVIR satellite image that geometric and atmospheric corrections are processed. The analysis results on the similarity between simulated image and target image show average R-2 of 0.88. In addition, the experimental results for each image application field showed that (1) in the case of natural color composite, pixels having a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 occupied 98% of the total image, (2) the results of the NDVI, an index frequently used in the forestry field, showed that the R-2 of two images was 0.91, and (3) the results of a similarity analysis showed that, after land cover classification was performed using maximum likelihood classification, an average similarity of 96% per land cover was achieved as compared with the target image. These results verify the similarity between the simulated image and target image, and the applicability of the simulated image.

249,"Beaver Slide is near 177.8km (110.5mi) on the Dalton Highway and the road gradient is approximately 11%, built on a hill side. Each year, soft spots, also commonly named as frost boils, were observed starting from late April and lasting for the entire summer. The frost boils have resulted in an extremely unsafe driving condition and frequent accident occurrences. Conventional repair methods cannot effectively solve this issue. A newly developed geotextile, which has high specific surface area, was installed in the selected test section to mitigate the frost-boil issue in August 2010. This type of geotextile can provide high wettability and relatively high suction (capillary force), consequently be able to laterally transport water (a high-directional transmissivity) under unsaturated conditions. Test results over the initial 2years had proved the effectiveness of the geotextile to alleviate frost heave and the subsequent thaw-weakening issue. However, there were still some concerns regarding its long-term performance, such as clogging of the microscopic drainage channels and mechanical failures. The data collected during the past 5 years were used to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the wicking fabric. A scanning electron microscope was used to explore the interaction between the wicking fabric and in situ soils, and to determine the condition of the fabric 5 years after the installation.

250,"Automated regulatory and contractual compliance checking requires automated rule extraction from regulatory and contractual textual documents (e.g., contract specifications). Automated rule extraction is a challenging task that requires complex processing of text. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the first step in automating the rule extraction process is automatically classifying the different documents and parts of documents (e.g., contract clauses) into predefined categories (environmental, safety, health, etc.) for preparing it for further text analysis and rule extraction. These categories are defined in a semantic model for normative reasoning. This paper presents a semantic, machine learning-based text classification algorithm for classifying clauses and subclauses of general conditions for supporting ACC in construction. The multilabel classification problem was transformed into a set of binary classification problems. Different machine learning algorithms, text preprocessing techniques, methods of text feature scoring, methods of feature weighting, and feature sizes were implemented and evaluated at different thresholds. The developed classifier achieved 100 and 96% recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

252,"As the area of Software Engineering (SE) matures the role of human factors in software development is commonly recognized as important. Increasingly we see empirical studies that investigate the connection between, for example, personalities and preferences, attitudes or performances of software engineers. Statistical analysis holds a key role by providing the means for uncovering associations between various facets of human factors and behavioral effects on projects and outcomes. Traditional statistical techniques tend to explore and interpret the multidimensional personality and behavioral data from an ""average-point"" perspective, targeting central trends. This paper introduces a methodology with statistical tools that can provide a new and different perspective for this type of SE data. It seeks the boundaries of a psychometric dataset and discovers reference or ""benchmark"" personalities, the archetypal personalities. Then, the method examines the placement of all individuals in the dataset in relation to the archetypes. Furthermore, the SE preference characteristics, or generally, any other types of behavioral SE data, are analyzed with respect to the archetypes. As a case to exemplify the methodology we analyze personality and project preference data from 276 master level SE students and compare to previous ""average-point"" statistical analysis of the same data. We also discuss how Archetypal Analysis, the heart of the proposed methodology, combined with multi-correspondence analysis might be of general use in empirical SE.

253,"Approximate adders are widely being advocated as a means to achieve performance gain in error resilient applications. In this paper, a generic methodology for analytical modeling of probability of occurrence of error and the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of error value in a selected class of approximate adders is presented, which can serve as performance metrics for the comparative analysis of various adders and their configurations. The proposed model is applicable to approximate adders that comprise of sub-adder units of uniform as well as non-uniform lengths. Using a systematic methodology, we derive closed form expressions for the probability of error for a number of state-of-the-art high-performance approximate adders. The probabilistic analysis is carried out for arbitrary input distributions. It can be used to study the dependence of error statistics in an adder's output on its configuration and input distribution. Moreover, it is shown that by building upon the proposed error model, we can estimate the probability of error in circuits with multiple approximate adders. We also demonstrate that, using the proposed analysis, the comparative performance of different approximate adders can be correctly predicted in practical applications of image processing.

Material and methods: Twenty-five neonates that required ECLS in between November 2010 and November 2015 were evaluated. Results: The median age was 12 days (range 3-28 days) and the median body weight was 3kg (range 2.5-5kg). Venoarterial ECLS was performed in all of the cases. Ascendan aorta-right atrial cannulation in 22 patients and neck cannulation in three patients were performed. The reason for ECLS was E-CPR in two patients, inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in seven patients, respiratory insufficiency and hypoxia in nine patients, low cardiac output (LCOS) in seven patients. Median duration of ECLS was four days (range 1-15). Hemorrhagic complications developed in 15, renal complications in 13, pulmonary complications in 12, infectious complications in 11, neurologic complications in three and mechanical complications in two of the patients. Weaning was successful in 15 of the patients. Eleven patients were successfully discharged. Conclusion: ECLS is an important treatment option that is performed successfully in many centers around the world to maintain life support in patients unresponsive to medical treatment. The utilization of this modality especially in newborns with congenital heart disease should be taken into consideration.

255,"Aim: To describe treatment pattern, complications, and direct medical costs associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Chinese urban patients. Methods: The 2013 China Health Insurance Research Association (CHIRA) urban insurance claims database was used to identify patients with AS. The identified patients were stratified by AS treatments for the comparisons of well established AS-related complications and direct medical costs. Conventional regression analyses adjusted the collected patient baseline characteristics to confirm the impact of treatments on complications and direct medical costs. Results: Of the identified 1299 patients with AS, 18.0% received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), 11.2% received immunosuppressant, 48.2% received NSAID plus immunosuppressant, 4.6% received biologic agents, and 17.9% received medications without indication for AS. Biologic group was associated with the lowest proportion of AS-related complications (8.3%) that was confirmed by multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio = 0.200, p=.017). The biologic group was also associated with highest direct medical costs (median: RMB=14,539) that were confirmed by the multiple generalized linear model (coefficient = 1.644, p<.001). Conclusions: Biologics were not commonly used for AS in Chinese patients likely due to their high cost. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential long-term clinical benefits associated biologic treatment for AS.

Loop gains for single and multiloop systems are reviewed. The SFG of the converter is then generated from the perturbed state-space averaged (SSA) equations, and the characteristic polynomial of the system is computed. By grouping terms associated with the gain of the error amplifier as the numerator, a unique definition of system loop gain is introduced, and locations for breaking the loop are discussed. System loop gains for both voltage- and current-programming converters with either trailing- or leading-edge modulation are derived. It is shown that for a SMPC, the loop gain measured by an analog injection method is the system loop gain, which determines the stability of the converter.

257,"A structure under damage normally exhibits nonlinear dynamic behaviors and time-dependent stiffness and damping. By estimating instantaneous dynamic characteristics of a structures is generally very useful when assessing structural damage in real application. This study presents a novel and effective approach that accurately estimating instantaneous dynamic characteristic of a structure using time-varying autoregressive exogenous (TVARX) model on Gabor frame. To evaluate the time-varying coefficient matrices of a time-series model, the proposed procedure applies Gaussian-based weighted function and Fourier transform on time series model, then the Gabor-transform-based time series formula could be obtained. The dynamic characteristics of a structure are determined from the coefficient matrices. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to traditional time-frequency analysis in accurately estimating instantaneous dynamic characteristics of a structure. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to process measured data for a steel frame specimen subjected to a series of base excitations in shaking table tests.

258,"A triaxial force-sensitive microrobot was developed to dynamically perturb skin in multiple deformation modes, in vivo. Wiener static nonlinear identification was used to extract the linear dynamics and static nonlinearity of the force-displacement behavior of skin. Stochastic input forces were applied to the volar forearm and thenar eminence of the hand, producing probe tip perturbations in indentation and tangential extension. Wiener static nonlinear approaches reproduced the resulting displacements with variances accounted for (VAF) ranging 94-97%, indicating a good fit to the data. These approaches provided VAF improvements of 0.1-3.4% over linear models. Thenar eminence stiffness measures were approximately twice those measured on the forearm. Damping was shown to be significantly higher on the palm, whereas the perturbed mass typically was lower. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for nonlinear parameters were assessed within and across individuals. Individual CVs ranged from 2% to 11% for indentation and from 2% to 19% for extension. Stochastic perturbations with incrementally increasing mean amplitudes were applied to the same test areas. Differences between full-scale and incremental reduced-scale perturbations were investigated. Different incremental preloading schemes were investigated. However, no significant difference in parameters was found between different incremental preloading schemes. Incremental schemes provided depth-dependent estimates of stiffness and damping, ranging from 300 N/m and 2 Ns/m, respectively, at the surface to 5 kN/m and 50 Ns/m at greater depths. The device and techniques used in this research have potential applications in areas, such as evaluating skincare products, assessing skin hydration, or analyzing wound healing.

260,"Aim. There is a longstanding debate over the long-term effect of intensive endurance training on cardiac function. Usually, echocardiography has been used as a global evaluation of left ventricular (LV) or right ventricular (RV) function and dimensions. Recently, speckle tracking strain (ST) has provided an analysis of regional RV and LV function. Thus, the intention of the study was to carefully evaluate cardiac function in a group of former world class swimmers applying longitudinal strain (LS) and circumferential strain (CS) analysis. Methods. Twelve athletes (45 +/- 1.5 years) of a former training group involved in high intensity endurance training were examined 24.9 +/- 4.3 years after the end of their active swimming career. An echocardiography was performed and LV function was analyzed based on CS and LS. Also, LS was evaluated for the RV. All measurements were performed for epicardium and endocardium independently. Results. Mean LV endocardial LS was -20.0 +/- 6.3 and epicardial LS -20.2 +/- 6.2. LV endocardial CS was -21.3 +/- 8.0 and epicardial CS -11.9 +/- 4.2. RV endocardial LS had a mean value of -26.4 +/- 6.1 and epicardial LS of -28.2 +/- 5.6. Conclusion. Twenty-five years after the cessation of endurance training, there was no evidence of a deterioration of RV or LV function as values for RV and LV strain measurements were within normal ranges.

261,"As the volumes of spatiotemporal trajectory data continue to grow at a rapid pace; a new generation of data management techniques is needed in order to be able to utilize these data to provide a range of data-driven services, including geographic-type services. Key challenges posed by spatiotemporal data include the massive data volumes, the high velocity with which the data are captured, the need for interactive response times, and the inherent inaccuracy of the data. We propose an infrastructure, Elite, that leverages peer-to-peer and parallel computing techniques to address these challenges. The infrastructure offers efficient, parallel update and query processing by organizing the data into a layered index structure that is logically centralized, but physically distributed among computing nodes. The infrastructure is elastic with respect to storage, meaning that it adapts to fluctuations in the storage volume, and with respect to computation, meaning that the degree of parallelism can be adapted to best match the computational requirements. Further, the infrastructure offers advanced functionality, including probabilistic simulations, for contending with the inaccuracy of the underlying data in query processing. Extensive empirical studies offer insight into properties of the infrastructure and indicate that it meets its design goals, thus enabling the effective management of big spatiotemporal data.

262,"BIM (Building Information Modeling), chiefly in the form of a 3D ""as-built"" model or information-sharing platform, has emerged as a powerful solution to the dynamic requirements of AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction). However, whereas fast and accurate reconstruction of building interiors is essential to any collaborative construction management process, manual creation and utilization of a 3D as-built model typically results in low productivity and erroneous modeling results. This paper proposes a semi-automated method that accounts for and resolves the major problems in the streamlined manual process of 3D as-built model creation in BIM. The method generates a 3D wireframe model combined with clutter data, which is then imported into a BIM tool for as-built modeling. The present study evaluates the proposed method by applying it to two typical rooms in a test building. The 3D as-built model was then subjected to an accuracy assessment using reference points acquired by a total station. The contributions of the proposed method, as compared with fully manual operation, are: (1) reduction of the huge data size of the original point clouds; (2) improvement of the productivity of as-built BIM creation with the aid of 3D wireframes; and (3) accuracy enhancement through a refinement process that entails segmentation and regularization. However, the proposed method is limited to building interiors consisting of planar structures; the modeling of detailed objects, such as windows and doors, unfortunately, still requires manual operation. Thus, further research on detail modeling and refinement is necessary in order to increase the method's automation and enhancement of its overall suitability for mapping complex indoor environments.

Due to the coupling of power through the vehicle itself, its wheels and the road on which it moves rather than through some mechanical device the vehicle is referred to as a 'through-the-road' (TTR) hybrid. A variant of the TTR hybrid has motors in the hub of the otherwise non-driven wheels, called in-wheel motors (IWM). This configuration enables an existing vehicle to be converted into a hybrid vehicle with minimal modification. The present work identifies specific operating modes and power flow of the TTR-IWM hybrid, specifically a retrofit-conversion hybrid, in comparison to the ordinary parallel hybrid vehicle. It discusses control architecture, control objectives and system parameters, along with specific control issues of the retrofit TTR-IWM hybrid vehicle.

265,"A very promising concept for small range extenders (peak power less than 40 kW) is represented by the 2-stroke, direct injection spark ignition engine, with scavenging and exhaust ports controlled by the piston, and an external pump. The most important issue to be addressed on this type of engines is the compliance with stringent rules on pollutant emissions, which depends on combustion patterns and the quality of the scavenging process. The latter is generally hindered by the symmetry of ports timings, but this handicap can be canceled by adopting a patented rotary valve, controlling the flow through a set of auxiliary transfer ports, and using a piston pump for delivering air to the power cylinder and enhancing the balance of the crankshaft. The paper reviews the design of a virtual engine, rated at 35 kW at 5600 rpm, and developed according to the above mentioned concepts. Design has been driven by CFD simulation, using, whenever possible, experimentally calibrated numerical models, or experimental information derived from similar projects. Particular care has been devoted to characterize the scavenging process and the flow patterns within the cylinder and through the ports, analyzing the influence of the rotary induction valve. Engine performance parameters have been predicted by using a well-established commercial software (GT-Power, by Gamma Technologies), while CFD-3D analyses have been carried out by means of a customized version of the KIVA-3V code. The whole study is conceived as the basis for the construction of a physical prototype. The power target has been virtually achieved with a very light and compact engine (estimated weight without the close-coupled electric motor: 35 kg). A three-way catalyst allows the engine to comply with the most stringent emission regulations, without relevant penalizations on fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the engine can work with lean mixtures, achieving a minimum specific fuel consumption comparable to a current automotive Diesel engine (223 g/kWh). This excellent result is due to the low friction and pumping losses of the 2-Stroke engine, as well as to the compactness of the combustion chamber and the capability to stratify the charge.

267,"as the deceleration of processor scaling due to Moore's law accelerates research in new types of computing structures, the need arises for rethinking operating systems paradigms. Traditionally, an operating system is a layer between hardware and applications and its primary function is in managing hardware resources and providing a common abstraction to applications. How does this function apply, however, to new types of computing paradigms? Are operating systems even needed for these new structures? This paper revisits operating system functionality for new computing paradigms. The structure of these new computers is uncertain as there are many possibilities such as neuromorphic, bio-inspired, adiabatic, reversible, approximate, quantum, combinations of these and others unforeseen [1]. We do know, however, that whatever these new computers will be, there will be some need to manage their resources, to provide programming support, to partition, scale, and connect them and to deal with (partial) failure, along with other traditional operating system's functionality. There might also be some new functionality, such as creating abstract control loops, reasoning about precision, new ways of reconfiguring, and more. We strongly believe that even if traditional operating systems functionality evolves, that the need for operating systems will remain in the new era of computing.

Ineffective handovers can cause major problems relating to the lack of delivery of appropriate care. Design. A prospective, cross-sectional design was conducted using a survey about clinical handover practices. Methods. Health professionals employed in public metropolitan hospitals, public rural hospitals and community health centres were involved. The sample comprised doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, including physiotherapists, social workers, pharmacists, dieticians and midwives employed in Western Australia, New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. The survey sought information about health professionals' experiences about clinical handover; their perceived effectiveness of clinical handover; involvement of patients and family members; health professionals' ability to confirm understanding and to clarify clinical information; role modelling behaviour of health professionals; training needs; adverse events encountered and possibilities for improvements. Results. In all, 707 health professionals participated (response rate = 14%). Represented professions were nursing (60%), medicine (22%) and allied health (18%). Many health professionals reported being aware of adverse events where they noticed poor handover was a significant cause. Differences existed between health professions in terms of how effectively they gave handover, perceived effectiveness of bedside handover vs. nonbedside handover, patient and family involvement in handover, respondents' confirmation of understanding handover from their perspective, their observation of senior health professionals giving feedback to junior health professionals, awareness of adverse events and severity of adverse events relating to poor handovers. Conclusions. Complex barriers impeded the conduct of effective handovers, including insufficient opportunities for training, lack of role modelling, and lack of confidence and understanding about handover processes.

However, fully automatic solutions reach their limitation; on the one hand, it is difficult to design general decision criteria able to select area of changes for images under various acquisition conditions, and on the other hand, the relevance of changes may differ from one user to another. In this letter, we introduce an alternative change detection method based on relevance feedback. The proposed algorithm is iterative and based on a query and answer model that: 1) asks the user questions about the relevance of his targeted changes and 2) according to these answers, updates change detection results. Our method is also based on a new formulation of canonical correlation analysis (CCA), referred to as context-aware CCA, that learns transformations, which map data from different input spaces (related to multitemporal satellite images) into a common latent space, which is sensitive to relevant changes while being resilient to irrelevant ones. These CCA transformations correspond to the optimum of a particular constrained maximization problem that mixes an alignment term with a context-based regularization criterion. The particularity of this novel CCA approach resides in its ability to exploit spatial geometric context resulting into better performances compared with other CCA approaches, as shown in experiments.

This study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological features of strictly defined NBNC-HCC. MethodsAmong HCC patients who underwent surgical resection at our affiliated hospitals in Nagano prefecture, Japan, between 1996 and 2012, 77 were negative for serum anti-HBV core/surface antibodies in addition to HBV surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody without signs of autoimmune liver disease, Wilson disease, or hemochromatosis. These patients were divided into the alcohol intake-positive group (ethanol intake >20g/day, n=31), non-alcoholic fatty liver group (steatosis >5% and ethanol intake <20g/day, n=30), and cryptogenic group (no ethanol intake or steatosis, n=16). Preoperative clinical parameters, tumor and background liver pathology, and prognosis were analyzed. ResultsAdvanced fibrosis and steatosis were detected in 64% and 60% of all patients, respectively. Approximately 85% of the alcohol intake-positive patients had advanced fibrosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver HCC subjects had the highest body mass index and prevalence of diabetes, but 30-40% had none to mild fibrosis. The cryptogenic group of HCC patients had the lowest incidence of accompanying hepatic inflammation/fibrosis but the largest tumor size. Recurrence/survival rates were comparable among the groups. ConclusionsLiver fibrosis and steatosis are risk factors of HCC regardless of past HBV infection and ethanol consumption. The present results also indicate the possibility of hepatocarcinogenesis independent of hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, ethanol intake, and past HBV infection.

273,"A weighted controller structure for DC-DC converters is proposed to deal with large-signal operations. For wide range variations of input voltage and load conditions of DC-DC converters, we firstly divide the pre-defined global operation space into local subspaces where each local linear compensator is designed for the corresponding subspace, and then all the local linear compensators are weighted into single controller structure. By doing so, the weighted controller can automatically decide which local linear compensator regulates the dynamics of DC-DC converter according to the operation conditions, and thus has the capability of self-adaptation to wide range of operating point variations. Furthermore, the prominent feature underlying the weighted control scheme is also that the nonlinearities of DC-DC converters is easily to be handled by linear compensation approaches that can be easily implemented with analog or digital control circuitries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller structure, a stand-alone DC-DC converter and a cascaded DC-DC converter system are taken as examples by simulation and experimental results.

The model can be combined with the models of the filter, cable, and inverter to form a complete drive system. It allows for a common and differential-mode high-frequency analysis in studying the bearing currents, electromagnetic interference, and overvoltages in the motor windings caused by the high-frequency reflections. The model phase is symmetrical meaning that the beginning and end of each phase are equal and the central part is inserted between them. This enables modeling of both the delta and star-winding connections of the three phases. The equations used to calculate the model parameters are presented. They are based on the common and differential-mode impedance measurements. The model can be simplified when considering only electric-discharge machining bearing currents, as they are affected only by the common-mode states. A simplified model to be used in the delta-winding connection is also presented. The model-calculated common and differential-mode impedances are compared with the impedances measured on a 6.5-kW outer-rotor brushless direct-current motor. This paper ends by providing the obtained simulation and measurement results for the common and differential-mode currents and bearing voltages of the studied three-phase delta-winding-connected electric motor.

Results: An implementation steering committee was established to oversee the implementation of the plan. Rather than adopting a uniform approach to assigning responsibility for the implementation of each strategy in the plan or developing specific costs and time frames for each strategy, a more pragmatic, flexible and opportunistic approach was taken. Most of the plan's strategies were implemented over a 7-year time frame using a combination of service reorientation and implementation of new programmes, some of which were funded from sources not anticipated during the development of the plan. Implementation required a dedicated driver, commitment at senior level and participation by many staff at many levels. Outcomes, monitored through data collected at 5-year intervals, revealed positive trends in a number of child and youth health indicators. Conclusions: The successful implementation of the strategic plan required pragmatism, flexibility, opportunism and the commitment and involvement of staff at all organisational levels. It is envisaged that this approach provides a firm base for future evidence-based developments to benefit the health and well-being of children, youth and their families and reduce health inequities.

In this paper, we focus on complex event processing based on pattern matching. When we apply pattern matching to probabilistic data streams, numerous matches may be detected at the same time interval because of the uncertainty of data. Although existing methods distinguish between such matches, they may derive inappropriate results when some of the matches correspond to the real-world event that has occurred during the time interval. Thus, we propose two grouping methods for matches. Our methods output groups that indicate the occurrence of complex events during the given time intervals. In this paper, first we describe the definition of groups based on temporal overlap, and propose two grouping algorithms, introducing the notions of complete overlap and single overlap. Then, we propose an efficient approach for calculating the occurrence probabilities of groups by using deterministic finite automata that are generated from the query patterns. Finally, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our methods by applying them to real and synthetic datasets.

278,"A wavelet transformation-based fuzzy reflex control method is proposed to prevent slip and maintain stable grasping posture for prosthetic hands. A key component of the control method is that the response time from slip detection to slip prevention is very short. The proposed control method mainly includes slip detection, reflex grasping force estimation, and use of a reflex controller. In the slip detection, initial slip information can be rapidly obtained via wavelet transformation as soon as disturbances cause the grasped object to slip. This shortens the response time of the reflex control. The initial slip information can then trigger the reflex control. In the grasping estimation, a reflex force estimation model is presented to estimate a force increment that is used to adjust to the desired force. In the reflex controller, a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to track the desired force. Finally, the proposed control method is applied to control a prosthetic hand with a single degree of freedom. The experimental results show that the proposed control method can adjust the grasping force and effectively prevent slip under disturbances. The time of slip prevention is less than 160 ms.

279,"Aim. The aim of the study was to examine sports injury pattern and establish cost of injuries in relation to training of 58 competitive badminton players in a Malaysian National Sports School. Methods. This one-year prospective observational study recruited all the 13-16 year old students after obtaining informed consent from their appointed guardian. All participants were requested to report any injuries, which were pain or disabilities that occur within the study period (September 1, 2008 to August 31, 2009) either during training or competition. Injured students were to seek treatment from the researcher(s) who made weekly visits and they were then followed up accordingly until they return to full training. Details and progress of the injuries were documented during each visit. Results. Sixty-three injuries were recorded. Soft tissue sprains/strains were the commonest injury (64%). About one third of the injuries occurred in the lower limb especially the knees and was followed by back injuries; 38% of the injuries did not require training modification, half of these injuries resumed training within one week. Upon full training, half of them were still symptomatic. Injury risk was 57%; injury rate was 0.9 injuries/ player/1000 training hours. Conclusion. Badminton injuries mostly involved the lower limb and almost all overuse injuries occurred in the lower limb. However, badminton injuries as a whole were predominantly sprains and strains, and not overuse in nature as widely believed.

Particularly, virtualization technology is designed to simulate the real computer hardware environment, and then make the operating system run in a virtual computer environment. Because the virtual machine software can simulate real computer hardware equipment, several operating systems are supported, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Unix etc. The main idea of this paper is to utilize the VMware software in operating system teaching. VMware provides a completely virtualized set of hardware for a specific operating system. Afterwards, we discuss how to design and implement an experimental platform with multiple operating systems based on VMware.

281,"As an overlay cognitive radio, transform domain communication system (TDCS) has been proposed to support reliable communications with low probability of interception. However, most of research on TDCS assume perfect synchronization to simplify algorithm design. In this paper, we present a low complexity symbol timing offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation method for practical TDCS applications. By utilizing preamble consisted of multiple identical training sequences, STO can be estimated by the demodulation procedure of cyclic code shift keying (CCSK), in which the circular correlation is performed by utilizing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Thus the estimation procedure is significantly simplified with considerable complexity reduction, which is analyzed and compared to other two conventional methods. The simulation results demonstrates that the proposed STO and CFO estimation scheme is a low complexity solution for TDCS in multipath Rayleigh fading channels with comparable estimation performance in terms of probability of incorrect timing offset and mean-square-error of CFO.

282,"As the stages of emergency response shift, it is an important task in the early stage of emergency response to handle emergency supply (ES) collection with fuzzy demand and multi-hub ES collection network. Taking into consideration the constraints such as no limit to collection time, capacity constraint to single hubs and different demand levels to be met by collection, this paper aims at establishing a mathematic planning model with two objectives, namely the shortest collection time and the optimal collection cost. In terms of algorithm design, the sequential enumeration method (SEM) was employed to solve the model, for higher iteration efficiency and lower difficulty level of the algorithm. The first step was to find the optimal ES collection time, collection route and allocation program in the direct shipment mode, the hub-and-spoke mode and the mixed mode. Then, the three modes were compared in terms of the collection route planning, the shortest collection time, the shortest collection route and the optimal collection cost of the entire ES collection network. The numerical example showed that compared with the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, the result of SEM is basically the same with that of SA algorithm; however, SEM is simpler, more practical and easier to operate, so that it is of better promotional value.

283,"Accurate evaluation of soil dynamic properties is essential for seismic response analyses of sites. In a number of studies, site properties have been identified using one-dimensional analyses. Such analyses uncouple the two-dimensional (horizontal) response of soil deposits, which is inherently coupled. This paper presents a system identification technique that takes into account the coupled two-directional response of soil deposits. The technique employs non-parametric estimates of the shear stresses derived from acceleration records provided by a vertical (downhole) array. A multi-yield surface plasticity approach is used to model the multi-dimensional stress-strain relation. The identification technique is first verified using finite elements computational simulations. This technique was then used to assess the coupled response of the Wildlife liquefaction research site (Imperial Valley, California). The identified shear moduli and shear wave velocities were found to be in a very good agreement with those measured in the field using crosshole seismic testing.

METHODS IFX-TL and ATI level were measured using prospectively collected samples obtained with informed consent from CD patients being treated at Asan Medical Center, South Korea. We analyzed the correlations between IFX-TLs/ATI levels and the clinical activity of CD (quiescent vs active disease) based on the CD activity index, C-reactive protein level, and physician's judgment of patients' clinical status at enrollment. The impact of concomitant immunomodulators was also investigated. RESULTS This study enrolled 138 patients with CD (84 with quiescent and 54 with active disease). In patients with quiescent and active diseases, the median IFX-TLs were 1.423 mu g/mL and 0.163 mu g/mL, respectively (P < 0.001) and the median ATI levels were 8.064 AU/mL and 11.209 AU/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). In the ATI-negative and -positive groups, the median IFX-TLs were 1.415 mu g/mL and 0.141 mu g/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). In patients with and without concomitant immunomodulator use, there were no differences in IFX-TLs (0.632 mu g/mL and 1.150 mu g/mL, respectively; P = 0.274) or ATI levels (8.655 AU/mL and 9.017 AU/mL, respectively; P = 0.083). CONCLUSION IFX-TL/ATI levels were well correlated with the clinical activity in South Korean CD patients. Our findings support the usefulness of IFX-TLs/ATI levels in treating CD patients receiving IFX in clinical practice.

286,"A space-time kinetics based inverse architecture method is suggested to analyze the reactivity variations associated with power excursions in a generic CANDU reactor. It is intended to provide diagnosis tools to gain enhanced control thereby ensuring safe operation of the plant. A methodology for analyzing the data available from the in core flux detectors and extracting the unknown reactivity coefficients is presented. The proposed system uses a reference model in conjunction with an optimal estimator. The reference model is composed of a state space representation of the space-time dynamics of neutron flux in the core, based on modal expansion approximation, and a time domain optimal estimator filter. We investigated three different estimation techniques based on recursive prediction error method (RPEM), dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF), and joint extended Kalman filter (JEKF). We compared their applicability to the estimation of coolant-void dynamic reactivity in loss-of-coolant accident in a CANDU reactor. The state equations also include the characteristics of the detector responses. The thermal hydraulic models were not included in the calculations. Two different types of detectors are considered in this analysis, the over prompt responsive Platinum detector of the reactor shutdown systems, and the under delayed responsive Vanadium detector of the flux mapping system.

288,"Areas within an agricultural field in the same season often differ in crop productivity despite having the same cropping history, crop genotype, and management practices. One hypothesis is that abiotic or biotic factors in the soils differ between areas resulting in these productivity differences. In this study, bulk soil samples collected from a high and a low productivity area from within six agronomic fields in Illinois were quantified for abiotic and biotic characteristics. Extracted DNA from these bulk soil samples were shotgun sequenced. While logistic regression analyses resulted in no significant association between crop productivity and the 26 soil characteristics, principal coordinate analysis and constrained correspondence analysis showed crop productivity explained a major proportion of the taxa variance in the bulk soil microbiome. Metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS) identified more Bradyrhizodium and Gammaproteobacteria in higher productivity areas and more actinobacteria, ascomycota, planctomycetales, and Streptophyta in lower productivity areas. Machine learning using a random forest method successfully predicted productivity based on the microbiome composition with the best accuracy of 0.79 at the order level. Our study showed that crop productivity differences were associated with bulk soil microbiome composition and highlighted several nitrogen utility-related taxa. We demonstrated the merit of MWAS and machine learning for the first time in a plant-microbiome study.

METHODS Interferon-free antiviral agents were used to treat 276 patients with chronic HCV1b infection, and changes in serum lipids of those who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) were examined. The treatment regimen included 24 wk of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) or 12 wk of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (SOF + LDV). SVR was achieved in 121 (85.8%) of 141 patients treated with DCV + ASV and 132 (97.8%) of 135 patients treated with SOF + LDV. In the two patient groups (DCV + ASV-SVR and SOF + LDV-SVR), serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were measured at baseline during treatment and at 4 and 12 wk after treatment. Then, longitudinal changes in lipid profiles were analyzed. RESULTS Serum levels of TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C were significantly increased throughout the observation period in both the DCV + ASV-SVR and SOF + LDV-SVR groups. During antivirus treatment, the increases in TC and LDL-C were significantly greater in the SOF + LDVSVR group than in the DCV + ASV-SVR group (P < 0.001). At 4 and 12 wk after the therapy, serum levels of TC and LDL-C were similar between the two groups and were significantly greater than those at baseline. Approximately 75%-80% of the increase in TC was derived from an increased LDL-C. In multiple regression analysis, the difference in therapy protocol (DCA + ASV or SOF + LDV) was an independent predictor that was significantly associated with the increase in TC and LDL-C at 4 wk of therapy. CONCLUSION Serum cholesterol significantly increased during SOF + LDV treatment. After treatment, HCV elimination was associated with a similar increase in cholesterol regardless of the therapy protocol.

291,"Assembling and simultaneously using different types of distributed computing infrastructures (DCI) like Grids and Clouds is an increasingly common situation. Because infrastructures are characterized by different attributes such as price, performance, trust, and greenness, the task scheduling problem becomes more complex and challenging. In this paper we present the design for a fault-tolerant and trust-aware scheduler, which allows to execute Bag-of-Tasks applications on elastic and hybrid DCI, following user defined scheduling strategies. Our approach, named Promethee scheduler, combines a pull-based scheduler with multi-criteria Promethee decision making algorithm. Because multi-criteria scheduling leads to the multiplication of the possible scheduling strategies, we propose SOFT, a methodology that allows to find the optimal scheduling strategies given a set of application requirements. The validation of this method is performed with a simulator that fully implements the Promethee scheduler and recreates an hybrid DCI environment including Internet Desktop Grid, Cloud and Best Effort Grid based on real failure traces. A set of experiments shows that the Promethee scheduler is able to maximize user satisfaction expressed accordingly to three distinct criteria: price, expected completion time and trust, while maximizing the infrastructure useful employment from the resources owner point of view. Finally, we present an optimization which bounds the computation time of the Promethee algorithm, making realistic the possible integration of the scheduler to a wide range of resource management software.

Small-scale agriculture located in urban areas is a highly effective and profitable way to provide these products to communities that are far from extensive commercial agricultural areas. Here we describe how remote sensing can be used with data mining approaches to monitor urban and peri-urban farms within cities in both developed and developing countries. Using very high resolution satellite imagery together with moderate and coarse resolution imagery and information from social media and the web, we analyze the usefulness of different methods to identify farms within urban boundaries in four countries. The analysis shows how a mixed-method approach is necessary in order to identify where urban farming is occurring and to monitor its change through time. Although remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices were useful, without ancillary data they are not effective at remotely mapping the locations of urban farms. However, remote sensing is a good way to monitor vegetation condition in locations where actively managed urban farms are known to exist. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study is devoted to designing optimised phase-coded sequences which keep spectral-compatible with the overlaid electromagnetic radiators and at the same time optimise the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). First, an intelligent dynamic spectrum information around the radar system is achieved by a radio environmental map. The information is introduced to form a constrained optimisation process aimed at improving the spectral compatibility and the radar detection performance. Second, the unimodularity requirement is necessary to make full use of transmit power and a similarity constraint is enforced to keep desired ambiguity function feature. Third, to resolve the resulting non-convex optimisation quadratically constrained quadratic problem, a relaxation and a randomisation procedure are applied. Therefore, the technique behaves a polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the performance analysis is given to show its effectiveness in terms of the SINR, the spectral shape, and the resulting auto-correlation function.

Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the predictors of the non-pharmacological intervention effect for old veterans with dementia and BPSD. MethodsA total of 141 old veterans with dementia living in two veterans' homes in northern Taiwan were recruited. The participants received an organized non-pharmacological intervention program of physical activity/exercise, music therapy, reality orientation, art therapy, reminiscence therapy and horticultural therapy once every week for 6months. All participants were evaluated by the Barthel Index, Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia before and after the intervention. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with improvement/maintenance of cognition (measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination), and improvement of BPSD (measured by NPI) and its subdomains during the intervention period. ResultsMultivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the improvement/maintenance of cognitive function was independently associated with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97, P=0.008), whereas participants with antipsychotic use were less likely to gain the effect (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.17-1.04, P=0.061). In addition, the improvement of BPSD was associated with a higher baseline total NPI score (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15-1.55, P<0.001), and the result was consistent in different NPI subdomains (psychotic domain: OR 1.96, 95% CI 0.83-4.58, P=0.123; affective domain: OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.25-2.13, P<0.001; behavior domain: OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.53-3.30, P<0.001) and caregiver burden (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24-2.14, P<0.001).

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a site-specific source control used to satisfy human, agricultural, and safety demands for water. This study analyzed the effects of capturing rainwater for a 12.5 year period (Jan 1999-Jun 2011) to provide three ecosystem services: water supplementation for indoor use, water supplementation for food production and groundwater recharge (GWR). A hydrologic analysis was completed using satellite rainfall data and a water balance approach. Two demand scenarios, indoor and outdoor, were considered, with water in excess of demand and storage directed to recharge groundwater. An economic analysis quantified RWH system net present value. The results indicated significant ecosystem services benefits were possible from RWH in India. RWH for the purpose of providing irrigation to a small garden and allowing overflow to a drywell for GWR was concluded to be an approach to maximize benefits. This scenario provided the greatest net present value (21,764-38,851 INR), fastest payback period (0.30-0.98 years), and recharge to groundwater of more than 40% of onsite rainfall. The benefit of the outdoor vegetable irrigation was determined and the results showed that the caloric demands of the typical Indian household (2.75kg of tomatoes and 1.05kg of lettuce) could be met with a 20m(2) garden, and excess food could be sold to offset the capital cost of the system and later for economic gain.

Materials and methods: The study included 39 older (mean age 67 +/- 5.9 years) and 36 younger (21.1 +/- 1.8 years) women. Tone, stiffness and elasticity of the UT and the SCM were measured by means of myotonometry (MyotonPRO) in lying and then, in sitting position. The results were compared using twoway analysis of variance. Results: Irrespective of the position, older women presented with significantly higher muscle tone, stiffness and elasticity than younger subjects (P < 0.05). In both groups, the transition from lying to sitting position resulted in a decrease (P0.05) of the SCM, and stimulated an increase in the tone, stiffness and elasticity of the UT (P < 0.05). The degree of changes in both study groups was similar, except from the absolute value of the UT elasticity, significantly higher increase in older women than in younger subjects (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Age contributes to an increase in the stiffness and tone of the UT and the SCM, as well as to a decrease in the elasticity of these muscles in female subjects.

The chemical composition of perovskite structures, solvent and heat treatments used in processing, additives, and deposition methods produce films with different morphologies. Their ability to be used with other organic and inorganic subcells makes them a useful component for an efficient, cost-effective approach to harvest solar energy. This review presents some of the latest approaches and considerations for the fabrication, architecture, and performance of perovskite-based solar cells. Various perovskite device architectures are discussed, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on performance and degradation.

307,"Aims and objectives To explore sleep quality in infertile women and examine the factors that contribute to sleep disturbances during intrauterine insemination treatment. Background Sleep disturbance is an important factor of human health and well-being. Sleep disturbances tend to occur among infertile women during intrauterine insemination treatment. Although many studies have focused on the high percentage of somatic symptoms and psychological distress in infertile women associated with their treatment, few studies have investigated factors linked to their sleep disturbances. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods The study was conducted during the period of September 2010-January 2011 in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Infertile women (n=117) who received assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination treatment completed a questionnaire. Demographic data, somatic symptoms, psychological distress and perceived sleep quality were collected. Results More than one-third (35%) of the infertile women reported having sleep disturbances. Their nausea symptoms and psychological distress were risk factors that contributed to sleep disturbance. Conclusions The variables of nausea and psychological distress significantly explained 30% of the sleep disturbances in the infertile women. The evaluation of nausea symptoms and/or psychological distress among infertile women is an important area of future research; such research should aim to identify the best compromise between infertility treatment and sleep quality. Relevance to clinical practice Clinical obstetrics and gynaecology nurses should develop strategies to help infertile women reduce their nausea symptoms and psychological distress during intrauterine insemination treatment to promote healthy sleep.

Our study was conducted to further investigate the model of social support and care for People Living with HIV/AIDS(PLHA), to explore their role in People Living with AIDS's quality of life (QOL) as reference for improving nursing policies for AIDS. Background. Social support and care are the most important factors impacting the QOL of People Living with HIV/AIDS, but most studies conducted upon the influence of social support and QOL of People Living with HIV/AIDS are mainly based on cross-sectional design. Design. Our study was a nonrandomised controlled community intervention study. Methods. The participants diagnosed as People Living with HIV/AIDS at Beijing You An Hospital received a comprehensive social support care from December 2013 to December 2014. To evaluate the impact of social support and care model on People Living with HIV/AIDS, our study analysed the different dimension scores of social support scale and quality of life before and after the intervention. Correlation between the net benefit value of social support and that of QOL from various dimensions were analysed. Results. There were significant differences in the score of objective support and usage of support (all p = 0.02) for social support. Net values of objective support score and usage of support were 0.25 and 0.19, respectively, after intervention. There were significant differences in physiological function, role physical, general health, vitality, social function, mental health, health transition and total score of quality of life (all p < 0.05). The canonical correlation analysis of net values of social support and QOL indicated that the first and second canonical correlation were statistically significant, with correlation coefficients of 0.53 (p = 0.00) and 0.21 (p = 0.04). Conclusion. Social support and care intervention model can effectively improve perceived subjective feeling on social support and QOL condition for People Living with HIV/AIDS. And strategies to improve social support and care intervention programmes are strongly encouraged. Relevance to clinical practice. The method is simple and cost-effective and could be a way to improve the quality of life condition for People Living with HIV/AIDS.

310,"As computer systems become more complicated, monitoring dataflows in a system becomes important for maintaining its performance. However, because conventional methods of dataflow monitoring are either too fine-grained or too coarse-grained, it is difficult to analyze application-specific performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a dataflow logger with suitable granularity for performance analysis. Our logger is implemented as a Java library, which tracks two types of dataflows: dataflows between objects inside a Java program, and dataflows between a Java object and a row and column in a relational database. That way, our logger can produce dataflow logs with rich semantics about the application's data model. We conduct an experiment with an example system and demonstrate that we can obtain dataflow logs useful for performance analysis. We also conduct detailed overhead analysis of our logger. Although our logger slows down the example system 13 times, we figure out major sources of the overhead. We argue possible solutions to the overhead.

311,"As a means to share knowledge, the community question answering (CQA) service provides users a chance to obtain or provide help by raising or answering questions. After a question is posted, the system must find an appropriate individual to answer this question. Several approaches have recently been proposed to find experts in CQA. In this paper, a new method to find experts in CQA is proposed by considering user post contents, answer votes, ratio of best answers, and user relation. The votes are used in post relation analysis to calculate user authority. The user's knowledge score can be calculated through topic analysis. Considering that a question usually includes many trivial words, an accurate distribution is nearly impossible to obtain with LDA. To solve this problem, vocabulary is extended by including the link information shown in a question; the top 10 relevant words from Wikipedia are provided for each tag. Tag-LDA models the user topic distribution and predicts the topic distribution of new questions. An experiment is conducted on Stack Overflow dataset, which is the world's largest computer programming CQA site. Experimental results showed approximately 2.97% to 7.79% performance improvement in nDCG@N metrics.

312,"Achieving sustainable energy systems involves complex decision-making processes. This article addresses the combination of life-cycle (LC) approaches and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for the sustainability assessment of energy systems. Through a literature survey of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tools for sustainability assessment of energy systems, the most commonly used criteria, data sources and tools are identified. Moreover, a review of the LC + DEA approaches available to date is performed in order to check their convenience to assess energy systems in terms of sustainability. In this sense, the central focus of the article is to explore and elucidate potentials of these combined approaches within sustainability-oriented MCDA in the field of energy. These potentials are mainly associated with the usefulness of sustainability benchmarks for decision-makers and the wide availability of DEA models and life-cycle approaches. Given the growing role of MCDA tools in energy scenario analysis and the innovative trends found in LC + DEA, a novel methodological framework is proposed: enriched energy systems modelling through (i) endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators and (ii) ranking and benchmarking of energy scenarios according to sustainability criteria using dynamic DEA. The LC + DEA concept emerges as a promising methodology to evaluate and rank prospective scenarios in energy planning, thus facilitating decision-making processes towards a sustainable energy future.

314,"As is well known, activity level measurement and fusion rule are two crucial factors in image fusion. For most existing fusion methods, either in spatial domain or in a transform domain like wavelet, the activity level measurement is essentially implemented by designing local filters to extract high-frequency details, and the calculated clarity information of different source images are then compared using some elaborately designed rules to obtain a clarity/focus map. Consequently, the focus map contains the integrated clarity information, which is of great significance to various image fusion issues, such as multi-focus image fusion, multi-rhodal image fusion, etc. However, in order to achieve a satisfactory fusion performance, these two tasks are usually difficult to finish. In this study, we address this problem with a deep learning approach, aiming to learn a direct mapping between source images and focus map. To this end, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained by high-quality image patches and their blurred versions is adopted to encode the mapping. The main novelty of this idea is that the activity level measurement and fusion rule can be jointly generated through learning a CNN model, which overcomes the difficulty faced by the existing fusion methods. Based on the above idea, a new multi-focus image fusion method is primarily proposed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain state-of-the-art fusion performance in terms of both visual quality and objective assessment. The computational speed of the proposed method using parallel computing is fast enough for practical usage. The potential of the learned CNN model for some other-type image fusion issues is also briefly exhibited in the experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While 85% of children outgrow allergies including cow's milk and eggs by five years of age, allergies to peanuts and seafood continue into adulthood. The school setting poses a high-risk environment for allergen exposure. The aim of the present study was to examine the availability, drivers and communication of school food allergy awareness and management policies/guidelines in one Australian education jurisdiction. Methods: A cross-sectional study comprising an online survey of principals on school allergy awareness (n = 100) was conducted in public, catholic and independent primary and high schools in an Australian education jurisdiction between August 2011 and November 2012. Results: Sixty-three per cent (17/27) of schools responding to the survey reported using food allergy management guidelines. An average of 13 students per school were reported to have a food allergy with 93% of schools reported having students with at least one food allergy. Parents, not government policy, were identified as primary drivers of food allergy guideline implementation and a third of schools provided anaphylaxis training annually. Communication of food allergy management was limited with only 42 school websites either providing access to policies/guidelines or providing a food allergy statement. Conclusions: Detailed awareness and management guidelines are integral for schools to adequately manage food-induced allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in the school environment. To enable this, national government support through legislation and policy is needed to ensure a consistent, up-to-date and policed approach to food allergy management in the Australian education sector.

317,"Aim: To compare the differences in contraceptive characteristics and the knowledge of emergency contraception (ECP) among women who used ECP after unprotected intercourse and those who sought an abortion. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted in a Hungarian university hospital among women for whom ECP was prescribed after unprotected intercourse (n=940) as well as women who presented for the termination of pregnancy (n=1592) between January 1, 2005 and November 20, 2006. Their knowledge of ECP and their experience with and attitudes toward ECP use were targeted. Results: The availability of ECP was well known (87.9%), but it was still greatly underutilized: applied by only 13 of the 1592 women who resorted to abortion. Primarily, the ECP group consisted of those who experienced a condom failure significantly more often (odds ratio [OR]=4.1), followed by those cases where ECP applications was a consequence of not using any kind of contraception (OR=3.8). Fewer than one third (32%) of the abortion seekers had previously used ECP, and only one fifth knew how to obtain it. Appropriate awareness of ECP was influenced by information obtained from health-care providers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.93) or school education (AOR=1.82). Conclusions: More thorough education is needed to provide a deeper knowledge of ECP use during contraceptive counseling for women seeking abortion, including those contraceptive mishaps where unintended pregnancy can be prevented by ECP.

319,"Aim. - Adiponectin is the most abundant adipokine and may play a key role in the interplay between obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Thus, this large population-based cohort investigated whether adiponectin at baseline and/or a decrease in adiponectin during follow-up is associated prospectively with the risk of incident MetS. Methods. - Using a prospective study design, the development of MetS was examined in 1134 healthy participants from the community. Plasma adiponectin was measured at study entry and again after a median follow-up of 9.4 years (IQR: 9.2-9.7). During follow-up, 187 participants developed MetS, and 439 presented with at least two components of MetS. Results. - During follow-up, adiponectin decreased in participants who developed MetS, whereas adiponectin was increased in those who did not develop MetS (P < 0.001). Those with low adiponectin levels (quartile 1) at baseline had an increased risk of developing MetS (OR: 2.92, 2.08-6.97; P < 0.001) compared with those with high levels (quartile 4). After adjusting for confounding variables, low adiponectin levels at baseline remained independently associated with MetS (OR: 2.24, 1.11-4.52; P = 0.017). Similarly, participants with a decrease in adiponectin during follow-up also had an increased risk of MetS (OR: 2.96, 2.09-4.18; P < 0.001). This association persisted after multivariable adjustments, including for baseline adiponectin (OR: 4.37, 2.77-6.97; P < 0.001). Finally, adiponectin levels at follow-up were inversely associated with an increase in the number of components of MetS (P <0.001); geometric mean adiponectin levels were 9.5 mg/L (95% CI: 9.0-10.0) for participants with no components vs 7.0 mg/L (95% CI: 6.3-7.9) for those with four to five components. Conclusions/interpretation. - Low plasma adiponectin levels at baseline and decreasing adiponectin levels during follow-up are both associated with an increased risk of MetS.

The proposed NA-LMS/F algorithm is realized by incorporating a p-norm-like into the cost function of the conventional least mean square/fourth (LMS/F) which acts as a combination of the l(0)- and l(1)-norm constraints. A reweighted NA-LMS/F (RNA-LMS/F) algorithm is also developed by adding a reweighted factor in the NA-LMS/F algorithm. The proposed RNA-LMS/F algorithm exhibits an improved performance in terms of the convergence speed and the steady-state error, which can provide a zero attractor to further exploit the sparsity of the channel by the use of the-norm adaption penalty and the reweighting factor. The simulation results obtained from the sparse channel estimations are given to verify that our proposed RNA-LMS/F algorithm is superior to the previously reported sparse aware LMS/F and the conventional LMS/F algorithms in terms of both the convergence speed and the steady-state behavior.

Patients in primary care who are affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression require care and follow-up based on their physical and mental health condition. Primary care nurses are increasingly expected to contribute to the care and follow-up of this growing clientele. However, little is known about the actual activities carried out by primary care nurses in providing this service in the Province of Quebec (Canada). Methods. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. Data were obtained through semistructured individual interviews with 13 nurses practising among patients with physical chronic disease in seven Family Medicine Groups in Quebec (Canada). Results. Participants described five activity domains: assessment of physical and mental health condition, care planning, interprofessional collaboration, therapeutic relationship and health promotion. Conclusion. The full potential of primary care nurses is not always exploited, and some activities could be improved. Evidence for including nurses in collaborative care for patients affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders has been shown but is not fully implemented in Family Medicine Groups. Future research should emphasise collaboration among mental health professionals, primary care nurses and family physicians in the care of patients with physical chronic disease and common mental disorders.

In the United States, although the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system has been widely accepted as the national standard for sustainable building design, its assessment of green buildings is challenging and time-consuming owing to its complicated process. Such a green building rating process could be accelerated and facilitated by using computer technology such as building information modeling (BIM), an innovative, new approach to building design, engineering, and construction management that has been widely used in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. To enable the green building rating for a building design in BIM applications, building information must be represented in such a way that the knowledge contained in LEED green building criteria can be extracted from the BIM model to support the assessment. In this paper, a building knowledge framework representing the LEED green building criteria will be presented.

Methods: A vignette-based study was conducted with 134 adolescents (M-age = 17.46 years) randomly assigned to a controlling or an AS condition, describing a maternal reaction to an alcohol use episode. Then, adolescents reported upon their experienced need frustration, their coping responses and their motivation to change alcohol use. Findings: Results indicated that adolescents in the controlling condition felt more frustrated in their needs for autonomy and relatedness that adolescents confronted with the AS reaction. When adolescents experienced frustration regarding their autonomy need, they coped by submitting to the maternal request, which in turn predicted greater motivation to change alcohol use. However, when they experienced frustration regarding their relatedness need, they engaged in oppositional defiance to the request, which in turn predicted lower motivation to change alcohol use. Conclusions: These results suggest that controlling maternal communication style relates to two distinct processes that have opposing effects on adolescents' motivation to change alcohol use.

The median [interquartile (IQR)] MELD scores for controls and elderly were 11 (9, 13.8) for the controls and 11.5 (9, 14.8) for elderly patients (P= 0.139). There were no significant differences in serum sodium and indication for TIPS. Thirty and 90-day follow-up laboratory test results were also similar between elderly and control patients. Event-free survival at 90 days was similar between controls and elderly patients [odds ratio (OR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3-2.5; P>0.05]. There was a trend toward greater hospitalization (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.52-5.95; P= 0.546) and mortality (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 0.3-14.01; P= 0.182). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest event-free survival is similar between nonelderly and elderly patients. Although statistically significant, there is a tendency toward greater mortality and hospitalization in the elderly.

Combining the fuzzy decision method with engineering practice and using two comparison theory solves the problem of quantifying the qualitative indexes. Comparison results show that it is more reasonable to place viscous dampers between main tower and girder, with longitudinal displacement on mid-span of girder on the same time. This method can provide a reference for structure selection in practical conceptual design phase.

The course allows top 12th grade students who are majoring in science and engineering to experience engineering design. At the end of the course, the students plan and implement-on a team basis-a real-time control system for an electric motor. The course is intended to increase its graduates' motivation in science and engineering, develop their systems thinking skills and train them in teamwork, as such skills will assist them in their future engineering work. The study described in this paper examined-through quantitative and qualitative tools-to what degree the course's first two objectives had been attained. Thirty-two students participated in the study and its findings indicate an improvement in the students' intrinsic motivation to study science and engineering (medium effect size) and in their systems thinking skills (large effect size).

338,"Based on taking full account of the building load and renewable energy output characteristics in cold regions, a multi-source hybrid heat pump system (MSHHPS) with seasonal thermal storage was proposed. The seasonal thermal storage comprehensively utilized solar energy, geothermal energy and air energy. The composition and operation modes of the system were introduced. The mathematical model of the main parts of the proposed system was established. The transition condition of the different operating modes of the system was determined. Taking a building in Harbin as the object for simulation analysis, the operation effect and the change of the soil temperature field of the system were obtained. The results showed that: The average coefficient of performance (COP) of the MSHHPS with seasonal thermal storage was 3.06 (in the Harbin region for 10 years), the soil thermal balance rate was 100.33% and the energy-saving rate was 29.84% comparing to the ground source heat pump system (GSHPS). For the initial investment, MSHHPS only required additional double-source heat pump unit, which accounted at 9.59%. The static payback period of the double-source heat pump unit was 4 years. The system can maintain efficient and economical operation in the typical cold regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

339,"Aim: The augmentation of late sodium current (I-Na.L) not only causes intracellular Na+ accumulation, which results in intracellular Ca2+ overload via the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current (reverse-I-NCX), but also prolongs APD and induces early afterdepolarizations (EAD), which can lead to arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, the inhibition of I-Na.L is considered to be a potential way for therapeutic intervention in ischemia and heart failure. In this study we investigated the effects of tolterodine (Tol), a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, on normal and veratridine (Ver)-augmented I-Na.L, reverse-I-NCX and APD in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, which might contribute to its cardioprotective activity. Methods: Rabbit ventricular myocytes were prepared. The I-Na.L and reverse-I-NCX were recorded in voltage clamp mode, whereas action potentials and Ver-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were recorded in current clamp mode. Drugs were applied via superfusion. Results: Tol (3-120 nmol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited the normal and Ver-augmented I-Na.L with IC50 values of 32.08 nmol/L and 42.47 nmol/L, respectively. Atropine (100 mu mol/L) did not affect the inhibitory effects of Tol (30 nmol/L) on Ver-augmented I-Na.L. In contrast, much high concentrations of Tol was needed to inhibit the transient sodium current (I-Na.T) with an IC50 value of 183.03 mu mol/L. In addition, Tol (30 nmol/L) significantly shifted the inactivation curve of I-Na.T toward a more depolarizing membrane potential without affecting its activation characteristics. Moreover, Tol (30 nmol/L) significantly decreased Ver-augmented reverse-I-NCX. Tol (30 nmol/L) increased the action potential duration (APD) by 16% under the basal conditions. Ver (20 mu mol/L) considerably extended the APD and evoked EADs in 18/24 cells (75%). In the presence of Ver, Tol (30 nmol/L) markedly decreased the APD and eliminated EADs (0/24 cells). Conclusion: Tol inhibits normal and Ver-augmented I-NaL and decreases Ver-augmented reverse-I-NCX. In addition, Tol reverses the prolongation of the APD and eliminates the EADs induced by Ver, thus prevents Ver-induced arrhythmia.

METHODS EA at 1 mA and 3 mA and Mox at 43 degrees C and 46 degrees C were applied to the Shangjuxu (ST37, bilateral) acupoints in model rats with visceral hypersensitivity. Responses of wide dynamic range neurons in dorsal horns of the spinal cord were observed through the extracellular recordings. Mast cells (MC) activity in the colons of rats were assessed, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5-HT3R) and 5-HT4R expressions in the colons were measured. RESULTS Compared with normal control group, responses of wide dynamic range neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord were increased in the EA at 1 mA and 3 mA groups (1 mA: 0.84 +/- 0.74 vs 2.73 +/- 0.65, P < 0.001; 3 mA: 1.91 +/- 1.48 vs 6.44 +/- 1.26, P < 0.001) and Mox at 43 degrees C and 46 degrees C groups (43 degrees C: 1.76 +/- 0.81 vs 4.14 +/- 1.83, P = 0.001; 46 degrees C: 5.19 +/- 2.03 vs 7.91 +/- 2.27, P = 0.01).

342,"As VLSI technology advances towards nanoscale devices, interconnect delay is becoming increasingly important, and could be effectively reduced using buffer insertion. The widely-used buffer insertion technique in industry is to insert a set of buffers on the chip, which may overlap some gates, and then greedily move the buffers to the nearest available buffer holes. The moving distance of inserted buffers largely affects the wirelength which may result in the increase of the interconnect delay. This necessitates efficient algorithms to minimize the moving distance of buffers for effective buffer insertion to obtain high-performance VLSI designs. This paper proposes an efficient, perturbation constrained buffer planning algorithm to maximize the candidate buffer holes with regarding to the feature of CPS based buffering design framework. Instead of directly moving buffers to the existing available buffer holes, the proposed algorithm changes the original placement by moving some gates tinily to provide more flexibility for buffer insertion. The integer linear programming based technique is designed for the physical design flow which allows small moving range of gates. Parallel technique is utilized to solve the ILP problems efficiently when the scale of chip is increasing. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm achieves at most 41.49% increase in the available buffer holes when compared to the algorithm with no gate movement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

343,"Background: Despite claims that the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets on access to safe drinking water have been met, many 100 s of millions of people still have no access. The challenge remains how to provide these people and especially young children with safe drinking water. Method: We report a longitudinal study designed to assess the effectiveness of an intervention based on provided treated drinking water in containers on self-reported diarrhoea in children. The intervention was ""1001 fontaines pour demain"" (1001 F) is a non-governmental not for profit organization (created in 2004 and based in Caluire, France) that helps local entrepreneurs treat package, and sell safe drinking water. Cases and controls were chosen at village and household level by propensity score matching Participants were visited twice a month over six months and asked to complete a diarrhoea health diary. Results: In total 4275 follow-up visits were completed on 376 participants from 309 homes. Diarrhoea was reported in 20.4% of children on each visit, equating to an incidence rate estimate of 5.32 episodes per child per year (95% confidence interval = 4.97 to 5.69). Compared to those drinking 1001 F water, children drinking surface water were 33% (95% CI -1 to 17%), those drinking protected ground water were 62% (95% CI 19 to 120%) and those drinking other bottled water 57% (95% CI 15 to 114%) more likely to report diarrhoea. Children drinking harvested rainwater had similar rates of diarrhoea to Children drinking 1001 F water. Conclusion: Our study suggests that 1001 F water provides a safer alternative to groundwater or surface water. Furthermore, our study raises serious concerns about the validity of assuming protected groundwater to be safe water for the purposes of assessing the MDG targets. By contrast our study provides addition evidence of the relative safety of rainwater harvesting.

This study evaluated treatment-associated changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in women with gynecologic cancer and compared changes among patients with different types of gynecologic cancer. Methods: BMD of the lumbar spine and femur was retrospectively analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 118 women who underwent treatment for gynecological cancers and 132 women without gynecologic cancers. The cohort included 55 women with cervical cancer who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, 33 with endometrial cancer (EC) who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and 30 with ovarian cancer who underwent bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD were assessed at baseline and 12 months after treatment. Areal BMD, expressed as grams of mineral/cm2 scanned, was compared with that in young healthy women (T-score). Results: Demographic characteristics and pretreatment BMDs, including T-scores, did not differ among cancer types. After adjustment for factors that can affect T-score, cancer type affected change in T-score 12 months after treatment. After adjustment for pretreatment age, parity, BMI and T-score, T-score 12 months after treatment was significantly lower in the EC than in the other groups. Conclusions: Women treated for gynecological cancer, particularly those with EC who undergo bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy, should be managed in a timely manner to prevent or minimize bone loss.

346,"As a novel learning algorithm for a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network, the extreme learning machine has attracted much research attention for its fast training speed and good generalization performances. Instead of iteratively tuning the parameters, the extreme machine can be seen as a linear optimization problem by randomly generating the input weights and hidden biases. However, the random determination of the input weights and hidden biases may bring non-optimal parameters, which have a negative impact on the final results or need more hidden nodes for the neural network. To overcome the above drawbacks caused by the non-optimal input weights and hidden biases, we propose a new hybrid learning algorithm named dolphin swarm algorithm extreme learning machine adopting the dolphin swarm algorithm to optimize the input weights and hidden biases efficiently. Each set of input weights and hidden biases is encoded into one vector, namely the dolphin. The dolphins are evaluated by root mean squared error and updated by the four pivotal phases of the dolphin swarm algorithm. Eventually, we will obtain an optimal set of input weights and hidden biases. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare the proposed algorithm with the standard extreme learning machine and three state-of-the-art methods, which are the particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine, evolutionary extreme learning machine, and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine, under 13 benchmark datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

348,"As the popularity of software-defined networks (SDN) and OpenFlow increases, policy-driven network management has received more attention. Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc.) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. In this paper, we first provide a more detailed explanation of how OpenSec converts security policies into a series of OpenFlow messages needed to implement such a policy. Second, we describe how the framework automatically reacts to security alerts as specified by the policies. Third, we perform additional experiments on the GENI testbed to evaluate the scalability of the proposed framework using existing datasets of campus networks. Our results show that up to 95% of attacks in an existing data set can be detected and 99% of malicious source nodes can be blocked automatically. Furthermore, we show that our policy specification language is simpler while offering fast translation times compared to existing solutions.

Growth performance and survival rate remained relatively constant under Zn stress, but was reduced under Cd exposure. Cd exposure also induced severe pyknotic nuclei, evident ultrastructure damage, and considerable lipid inclusions in the hepatocytes. However, these phenomena were not pronounced under Zn exposure. The negative effects caused by Cd may be explained by an increase in hepatic oxidative damage, as reflected by the enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PC). The reduced activity of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) may result in the enhanced hepatic oxidative damage, though the mRNA and protein levels of both genes increased and remained unchanged respectively. On the contrary, Zn up-regulated the levels of mRNA, protein and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD, which may contribute to the decreased LPO levels. Nonetheless, the sharply up-regulated mRNA levels of CAT did not induce an increase in the protein and activity levels of CAT under Zn stress. Furthermore, transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression parelleled with its target genes, suggesting that Nrf2 is required for the protracted induction of antioxidant genes. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that essential and non-essential metals induced some differences in oxidative damage in fish. The differences were not caused by the transcriptional level of related genes but depended on post-transcriptional modifications. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

As typical feature selection methods, Lasso and its variants using the l(1)-norm based regularization have received much attention in recent years.

In this paper, we propose a hypergraph regularized sparse feature learning method, where the high-order relationships among samples are modeled and incorporated into the learning process. Specifically, we first construct a hypergraph with multiple hyperedges to capture the high-order relationships among samples, followed by the computation of a hypergraph Laplacian matrix.

We conduct a series of experiments on a number of data sets from UCI machine learning repository, and two real-world neuroimaging based classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising classification results, compared with several well known feature selection approaches.

357,"Assignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a computational bottleneck in the process of analyzing microbial communities. Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications. IMPORTANCE The analysis of microbial communities from diverse environments using 16S rRNA gene sequencing has expanded our knowledge of the biogeography of microorganisms. An important step in this analysis is the assignment of sequences into taxonomic groups based on their similarity to sequences in a database or based on their similarity to each other, irrespective of a database. In this study, we present a new algorithm for the latter approach. The algorithm, OptiClust, seeks to optimize a metric of assignment quality by shuffling sequences between taxonomic groups. We found that OptiClust produces more robust assignments and does so in a rapid and memory-efficient manner. This advance will allow for a more robust analysis of microbial communities and the factors that shape them.

Method: MEDLINE and PsychINFO search identified 986 studies published from 1990 to December 2016. Two independent researchers identified eligible studies. Study quality was assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: The systematic search resulted in 1 to 14 longitudinal studies per parenting practice. Studies scored between 4 and 9 on the NOS, indicating an overall moderate quality. The results of complete smoking house rules showed a preventive effect on smoking onset. Furthermore, availability of cigarettes, frequency and quality of communication, parental reaction (i.e., conflict engagement) and norms showed significant and non-significant effects. Significant results were in line with expectations: availability of cigarettes and frequent.communication about smoking predicted smoking, whereas a high quality of communication, negative reactions or punishments and setting norms by parents showed a preventive effect. No effects were found for non-smoking agreements. The number of studies was too limited to draw conclusions about other parenting strategies. More research on (1) reliable and valid instruments, (2) other stages of smoking in addition to onset, and (3) potential moderators and mediators is warranted.

360,"Automatic registration of multimodal remote sensing data [e.g., optical, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)] is a challenging task due to the significant nonlinear radiometric differences between these data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel feature descriptor named the histogram of orientated phase congruency (HOPC), which is based on the structural properties of images. Furthermore, a similarity metric named HOPCncc is defined, which uses the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) of the HOPC descriptors for multimodal registration. In the definition of the proposed similarity metric, we first extend the phase congruency model to generate its orientation representation and use the extended model to build HOPCncc. Then, a fast template matching scheme for this metric is designed to detect the control points between images. The proposed HOPCncc aims to capture the structural similarity between images and has been tested with a variety of optical, LiDAR, SAR, and map data. The results show that HOPCncc is robust against complex nonlinear radiometric differences and outperforms the state-ofthe- art similarities metrics (i.e., NCC and mutual information) in matching performance. Moreover, a robust registration method is also proposed in this paper based on HOPCncc, which is evaluated using six pairs of multimodal remote sensing images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multimodal image registration.

Experimental results show that the JMSS method not only outperforms other state-of-the-art stereo matching methods on test sequences with abundant movements, but also performs well in some real-world scenes with fixed and moving stereo cameras, respectively, in particular under some extreme conditions of real stereo visions. Additionally, the proposed JMSS method can be implemented in real time, which is superior to other state-of-the-art methods. The time efficiency is also a very important consideration in our algorithm design. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

364,"A theoretical analysis of the generation of electrical streaming currents and electrical power by two-phase flow in a rectangular capillary is presented. The injection of a second, non-conducting fluid phase tends to increase the internal electrical resistance of the electrical generator, thereby increasing the power output. If the viscosity of the injected fluid is large, the resulting high shear rate in the low-viscosity fluid at the wall generates a large streaming current and the power generated is further enhanced. However, if the injected fluid viscosity is low, the wall shear rate in the more viscous suspending fluid is reduced, as are streaming currents. Power generation would be small but for capillary effects at the ends of the bubbles that increase the pressure drop along the capillary above that expected for annular flow.

Compared with systems based on DRAM as main memory, PCM (Phase change memory), a new memory technology, can significantly reduce power consumption because data stored in PCM does not disappear when the device is powered down. This paper will first discuss several PCM-RAM-based hybrid systems. In these systems, the amount of read-only data influences the design of the hybrid structure. In the experiment section, it was found that almost 80% of data was semi-read-only.

366,"As a preprocessing step for computer vision tasks, research on generating superpixels of an image has been widely conducted recently. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic superpixel generation algorithm by simplifying the 3D triangle mesh modeled from a 2D input image. The simplification is performed based on a modified quadric error metric (QEM) method. The pipeline of our algorithm is simple. Given an image, we first turn it into a 2D triangle mesh and then lift the mesh to 3D based on the gray values of the image. We then simplify the 3D mesh based on the modified QEM method which encodes the features in the image intrinsically to ensure feature-aware superpixels. After obtaining the simplified mesh, we map it back to the 2D image to generate triangular-shaped superpixels. Our algorithm is fully automatic. The number of superpixels can be controlled intuitively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

367,"Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) belong to a class of Pro/Hyp-rich glycoproteins and are some of the most complex types of macromolecules found in plants. In the economically important plant species, Brassica rapa, only chimeric AGPs have been identified to date. This has significantly limited our understanding of the functional roles of AGPs in this plant. In this study, 64 AGPs were identified in the genome of B. rapa, including 33 classical AGPs, 28 AG peptides and three lys-rich AGPs. Syntenic gene analysis between B. rapa and A. thaliana suggested that the whole genome triplication event dominated the expansion of the AGP gene family in B. rapa. This resulted in a high retained proportion of the AGP family in the B. rapa genome, especially in the least fractionated subgenome. Phylogenetic and motif analysis classified the classical AGPs into six clades and three orphan genes, and the AG peptides into three clades and five orphan genes. Classical AGPs has a faster rate of molecular evolution than AG peptides revealed by estimation of molecular evolution rates. However, no significant differences were observed between classical AGPs and lys-rich AGPs. Under control conditions and in response to phytohormones treatment, a complete expression profiling experiment has identified five anther-specific AGPs and quite a number of AGPs responding to abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate and/or gibberellin. In this study, we presented a bioinformatics approach to identify important types of AGPs. Moreover, the association between their function and their protein structure, as well as the evolution and the expression of AGP genes were investigated, which might provide fundamental information for revealing the roles of AGPs in B. rapa.

368,"Autonomy and adaptability are key features of intelligent agents. Many applications of intelligent agents, such as the control of ambient intelligence environments and autonomous intelligent robotic systems, require the processing of information coming in from many available sensors to produce adequate output responses in changing scenarios. Autonomy, in these cases, applies not only to the ability of the agent to produce correct outputs without human guidance, but also to its ubiquity and/or portability, low-power consumption and integrability. In this sense, an embedded electronic system implementation paradigm can be applied to the design of autonomous intelligent agents in order to satisfy the above mentioned characteristics. However, processing complex computational intelligence algorithms with tight delay constraints in resource-constrained and low power embedded systems is a challenging engineering problem. In this paper a single-chip intelligent agent based on a computationally efficient neuro-fuzzy information processing core is described. The system has been endowed with an information preprocessing module based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that permits a substantial reduction of the input space dimensionality with little loss of modeling capability. Moreover, the PCA module has been tested as a means to achieve deep adaptability in changing environment dynamics and to endow the agent with fault tolerance in the presence of sensor failures. For data driven trials and research, a data set obtained from an experimental intelligent inhabited environment has been used as a benchmark system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Purpose: To evaluate the visibility and appearance of the rotator cable in various conditions of the rotator cuff, using indirect magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography. Material and Methods: Indirect MR arthrography images from 27 patients (age range, 20-63 years) with normal rotator cuffs, and 47 (age range, 20-73 years) with tendinosis, 32 (age range, 49-71 years) with partial-thickness tears, and 55 (age range, 44-75 years) with full-thickness tears in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons (SST-ISTs) were included in this study. In these various rotator cuff conditions, the visibility and appearance (thickness and width) of the rotator cable and the relationships between the rotator cable appearance, rotator cuff tear size, rotator cuff thickness, and patient's age were assessed. Results: On the sagittal MR images, all rotator cables were visible in the normal rotator cuffs and tendinosis/partial-thickness tears of SST-ISTs. In the order of normal cuff, tendinosis, partial-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear of SST-ISTs, the rotator cable tended to become thicker (1.07, 1.27, 1.32, and 1.59 mm, respectively) and narrower (12.1, 10.68, 10.90, and 8.55 mm, respectively). The thickness of the rotator cable was significantly positively correlated with the rotator cuff thickness in the normal rotator cuffs (coefficient, 0.49; P = 0.010) and tendinosis of SST-ISTs (coefficient, 0.53; P < 0.001), but was not correlated with patients' age. Conclusion: On sagittal plane of indirect MR arthrography, most rotator cables were visible. The appearance of the rotator cable changed according to the rotator cuff condition.

370,"A wind turbine emulator is an important hardware to simulate wind energy conversion systems. The emulator hardware is often built by a coupled motor as prime mover and controlled by a variable speed drive to the shaft of an electrical generator. In this work, we propose, design and implement a novel wind turbine emulator by using a squirrel cage induction machine and permanent magnet induction generator. The control of the prime mover is performed by an IGBT AC drive. The drive itself is controlled by a 32-bit microprocessor. Furthermore, the computer supervises the drive and generates the wind patterns and sets the configuration of wind turbine models. This allows the user to define different wind patterns and to emulate different wind turbines. The combination of the PI controller, the computer supervision, and the microprocessor ensures an accurate performance of entire system. The frequency of the generated voltage is proportional to the shaft rotational speed. Therefore, the output voltage frequency is used as a rotational speed meter. RS-485 is the main communication channel between the drive and the computer. Finally, the results demonstrate the effective and accurate performance of the proposed emulator in reproducing the dynamics of an actual wind turbine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

372,"Because water is a key at-risk resource, improved water management is essential. In terms of quantity, the two major alternatives in water management can be grouped into: (i) improving efficiency in water use; and (ii) exploring alternative water sources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of the most promising alternative water sources, since rainwater can easily be collected and used without significant treatment for non-potable purposes. However, the economical viability of these systems is not always assured. This paper examines the most relevant technical and economical issues in designing domestic RWH systems, evaluating the technical feasibility and economical viability of this technology in the particular weather and water use in Portugal. The evaluation is performed for a single-family residence, where the water use pattern was monitored. The precipitation pattern is characterized for two locations in Portugal, Porto and Almada, since they represent two different scenarios for RWH. The RWH and water savings efficiency were assessed and payback period estimated for both cities. It was found that, for an optimum rainwater tank, the water savings potential are similar for both locations, despite the differences in the average annual precipitation. A simple rule for estimating the optimum tank capacity for single-family households in Portugal is proposed. A sensitivity analysis shows an important influence of water fees on the economical viability of RWH systems in single-family houses in Portugal, namely when compared to changes in the consumption pattern.

The objective of the present study was to determine predictive factors for hospitalizations in people with dementia. MethodsA total of 70 individuals with dementia living in a veterans' home in southern Taiwan were consecutively enrolled. During prospective follow up, all hospitalization events were recorded. ResultsThe mean age of residents with dementia was 86.14.0years, and the mean follow-up time for this population was 2.2 +/- 1.1years. Among individuals, 62.9% suffered from malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition (minimal nutritional assessment-short form score 11), and 8.6% of individuals had a body mass index of <18.5Kg/m(2). There were 52 (74.3%) individuals who had previously fallen. Overall, 51 of 70 residents were hospitalized during the follow-up period. In those individuals with previous falls, there was a significantly increased risk of hospitalization (odds ratio 5.61, 95% CI 1.18-26.7). Furthermore, three factors were significantly associated with the risk of fall, including handgrip strength, malnutrition and Mini-Mental State Examination score. ConclusionsThe results of the present study showed that hospitalization was a frequent event in residents with dementia living in a long-term care facility. The major predictor for hospital admission was history of a previous fall. Screening those with dementia for history of injurious falls and associated risk factors for falling could help identify those at risk of hospitalization, thus necessitating a comprehensive intervention to reduce hospitalization.

376,"AIM To study mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the assessment of murine colitis and carcinogenesis. METHODS C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 3% dextran sodium-sulfate (DSS) for three, six or nine days to study the development of acute colitis. Ultrasound was performed with and without the addition of unspecific contrast agents. MAdCAM-1-targeted contrast agent was used to detect and quantify MAdCAM-1 expression. Inflammatory driven colorectal azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced carcinogenesis was examined on day 42 and 84 using VEGF-targeted contrast agent. Highly specific tissue echogenicity was quantified using specialized software. Sonographic findings were correlated to tissue staining, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry to quantify the degree of inflammation and stage of carcinogenesis. RESULTS Native ultrasound detected increased general bowel wall thickening that correlated with more progressed and more severe DSS-colitis (healthy mice: 0.3 mm +/- 0.03 vs six days DSS: 0.5 mm +/- 0.2 vs nine days DSS: 0.6 mm +/- 0.2, P < 0.05). Moreover, these sonographic findings correlated well with clinical parameters such as weight loss (r(2) = 0.74) and histological damage (r(2) = 0.86) (P < 0.01). In acute DSS-induced murine colitis, CEUS targeted against MAdCAM-1 detected and differentiated stages of mild, moderate and severe colitis via calculation of mean pixel contrast intensity in decibel (9.6 dB +/- 1.6 vs 12.9 dB +/- 1.4 vs 18 dB +/- 3.33, P < 0.05). Employing the AOM/DSS-induced carcinogenesis model, tumor development was monitored by CEUS targeted against VEGF and detected a significantly increased echogenicity in tumors as compared to adjacent healthy mucosa (healthy mucosa, 1.6 dB +/- 1.4 vs 42 d, 18.2 dB +/- 3.3 vs 84 d, 18.6 dB +/- 4.9, P < 0.01). Tissue echogenicity strongly correlated with histological analysis and immunohistochemistry findings (VEGF-positive cells in 10 high power fields of healthy mucosa: 1 +/- 1.2 vs 42 d after DSS start: 2.4 +/- 1.6 vs 84 d after DSS start: 3.5 +/- 1.3, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Molecularly targeted CEUS is a highly specific and non-invasive imaging modality, which characterizes murine intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis in vivo.

377,"As the world's population continues to grow, water pollution is presenting one of the biggest challenges worldwide. More wastewater is being generated and the demand for clean water is increasing. To ensure the safety and health of humans and the environment, highly efficient wastewater treatment systems, and a reliable assessment of water quality and pollutants are required. The advance of holistic approaches to water quality management and the increasing use of ecological water treatment technologies, such as constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), challenge the appropriateness of commonly used water quality indicators. Instead, additional indicators, which are direct measures of the processes involved in the stabilisation of human waste, have to be established to provide an in-depth understanding of system performance. In this study we identified the sterol composition of wastewater treated in WSPs and assessed the suitability of human sterol levels as a bioindicator of treatment efficiency of wastewater in WSPs. As treatment progressed in WSPs, the relative abundance of human faecal sterols, such as coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and sitostanol decreased significantly and the sterol composition in wastewater changed significantly. Furthermore, sterol levels were found to be correlated with commonly used wastewater quality indicators, such as BOD, TSS and E. coli. Three of the seven sterol ratios that have previously been used to track sewage pollution in the environment, detected a faecal signal in the effluent of WSPs, however, the others were influenced by high prevalence of sterols originating from algal and fungal activities. This finding poses a concern for environmental assessment studies, because environmental pollution from waste stabilisation ponds can go unnoticed. In conclusion, faecal sterols and their ratios can be used as reliable indicators of treatment efficiency and water quality during wastewater treatment in WSPs. They can complement the use of commonly used indicators of water quality, to provide essential information on the overall performance of ponds and whether a pond is underperforming in terms of stabilising human waste. Such a holistic understanding is essential when the aim is to improve the performance of a treatment plant, build new plants or expand existing infrastructure. Future work should aim at further establishing the use of sterols as reliable water quality indicators on a broader scale across natural and engineered systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was to analyse water table fluctuations in an outcrop area of the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) in Brotas/SP, Brazil, using data from a groundwater monitoring network. The water table dynamic was modelled using continuous time series models that reference the hydrogeological system upon which they operate. The model's climatological inputs of precipitation and evapotranspiration generate impulse response (IR) functions with parameters that can be related to the physical conditions concerning the hydrological processes involved. The interpretation of the model parameters from two sets of monitoring wells selected at different land-use sites is presented, exemplifying the effect of different water table depths and the distance to the nearest drainage location. Systematic trends of water table depths were also identified from model parameters at specific periods and related to plant development, crop harvest and land-use changes.

379,"As a fundamental optimization problem, the vehicle routing problem has wide application backgrounds and has been paid lots of attentions in past decades. In this paper we study its applications in data gathering and wireless energy charging for wireless sensor networks, by devising improved approximation algorithms for it and its variants. The key ingredients in the algorithm design include exploiting the combinatorial properties of the problems and making use of tree decomposition and minimum weighted maximum matching techniques. Specifically, given a metric complete graph G and an integer k >0, we consider rootless, uncapacitated rooted, and capacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problems in G with an aim to find k rootless (or rooted) edge-disjoint cycles covering the vertices in V such that the maximum cycle weight among the k cycles is minimized. For each of the mentioned problems, we develop an improved approximate solution. That is, for the rootless min-max cycle cover problem, we develop a (5 1/3 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm; for the uncapacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problem, we devise a (6 1/3 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm; and for the capacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problem, we propose a (7 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm. These algorithms improve the best existing approximation ratios of the corresponding problems 6 + epsilon, 7 + epsilon, and 13 + epsilon, respectively, where epsilon is a constant with 0 < + < 1. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results show that the actual approximation ratios delivered by the proposed algorithms are always no more than 2, much better than their analytical counterparts.

Material and methods: we collected the medical reports on all the matches held during the 2015 America Cup, in Chile, in 2015. Twelve American teams took part in the championship, consisted of 26 matches with a total of 276 players. The physician for each team sent a request form of the traumatic injuries sustained, including the time at which the injury was produced, the location and diagnosis, its severity and the circumstances (contact injury, sanction, treatment required). Results: the mean number of minutes played was 233 (SD: 147) (5-570) minutes. An injury occurred every 58 minutes, which means that there were 17.25 injuries per 1,000 minutes of match time. We found 44 injuries in 30 players. There were 14 non-contact injuries, and 30 contact injuries, of which 13 were declared fouls and resulted in cards being given. Five teams had one injured player, two had 2, two had 4, and one had 25 injuries. The most frequent injuries were those to the lower limbs. The muscles strains happened in the second part of the second half of the match, the ACL rupture at the end of the first half, and the other sprains and strains in the second half. The contusions occurred at all times throughout the match, although they seemed to be concentrated towards the end of the first half, while the cases of tendinitis were caused in the first part of the second half.

In this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded TPW over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter Delta Tb-18.7/Delta Tb-23.8 based on the combination of AMSR-E and MODIS observations. There are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of TPW using DEM. To obtain a high resolution TPW, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded TPW to a fine scale of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees using DEM and NDVI. In addition, the downscaled TPW was further calibrated using high precision TPW from MODIS in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. Finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded TPW were validated against SuomiNet GPS retrieved TPW on a global scale. The RMSE for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global TPW is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In addition, the RMSE for the downscaled 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded global TPW is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. An obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with MODIS TPW product is that it can retrieve TPW under cloudy sky condition over land. The algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 and provides the long-term global daily TPW over land since the launch of Aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies.

It was hypothesized that T-and P/Q-type channels are involved in the contraction of human brain and mammary blood vessels. Methods: Internal mammary arteries from bypass surgery patients and cerebral arterioles from patients with brain tumours with and without hypertension were tested in a myograph and perfusion set-up. PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed on isolated blood vessels. Results: The P/Q-type antagonist x-agatoxin IVA (10(-8) mol L-1) and the T-type calcium blocker mibefradil (10(-7) mol L-1) inhibited KCl depolarization- induced contraction in mammary arteries from hypertensive patients with no effect on blood vessels from normotensive patients. omega-Agatoxin IVA decreased contraction in cerebral arterioles from hypertensive patients. L-type blocker nifedipine abolished the contraction in mammary arteries.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted from the PubMed, ENBASE, and Springer link database up to April 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the strength of association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) and AS risk. A subgroup analysis based on geographic region and a sensitivity analysis were also conducted. Results: Five studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including 918 cases and 845 controls. The results showed that no significant association was found between AS and CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) for the additive model (G vs. A), dominant model (GG+AG vs. AA), co-dominant model (GG vs. AA, AG vs. AA) and recessive model (GG vs. AG+AA). The OR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.38), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89-1.51), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75-1.46), 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.52) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.79-1.23), respectively. Although subgroup analysis demonstrated no association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) polymorphisms and susceptibility to AS in Europe and Taiwan, an association was found in Iran through both the co-dominant and dominant models. Exclusion of any individual study did not alter the significance of the final outcome, excepting the result by omitting the study by Huang etal. Conclusions: The present results suggest that the CTLA-4 may not be a major susceptibility locus in humans with AS. The relationship between them may be affected by different geographic populations.

Previous research has focused on the effects on sand entrainment and mass transport of surface features and wind velocity, but the influence of air density, which strongly constrains airflow characteristics and the resulting sand flow, has not been widely considered. In the present study, entrainment, saltation characteristics and transport rates were examined at nine experimental sites ranging in elevation from -154m below sea-level (Aiding Lake) to 5076m above sea-level (Tanggula Mountain pass on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau). At each site, a portable wind tunnel and high-speed camera system were set up, and the friction wind velocity, threshold friction velocity and sand flow structure were observed systematically. For a given volumetric airflow, lower air density increases the wind velocity. Low air density also creates a high threshold friction velocity. The Bagnold wind erosion threshold model remains valid, but the value of empirical parameter A decreased with decreasing air density and ranged from 010 to 007, the smallest values reported in the literature. For a given wind velocity, increased altitude reduced total sand transport and creeping, but the saltation rate and saltation height increased. The present results provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of the initiation and transport of sand by wind in regions with an extreme temperature or altitude (for example, alpine deserts and low-lying lake basins) or on other planets, including Mars. These results also provide theoretical support for improved sand-control engineering measures. The data and empirical equations provided in this paper improve the ability to estimate threshold and transport conditions for wind-blown sand.

390,"Beam-type periodic materials with high connectivity have displayed unique band gap behaviors analogous to locally resonant band gaps in acoustic metamaterials. In this study, structurally square re-entrant honeycomb, one highly connected lattice configuration featuring eight folded beams connected at each joint, is introduced to be the host structure of a smart material to tailor the elastic wave propagation. Finite length piezoelectric patches connected with negative capacitance shunting circuits are arranged on the beam surfaces, providing active adjustment via altering the parameters of shunting circuits. The characteristics of band structure of this smart structured material are investigated through the application of finite element method in conjunction with the Bloch theorem. Results demonstrate that the variation of internally resonant band gaps induced by the alteration of the piezoelectric patches to those positions and mechanical properties, can be precisely estimated by simple heuristic models proposed according to deformation characteristics of standing wave modes. This founding could promote the practical implementation of the highly connected honeycombs in the adaptive control to elastic wave.

391,"As a well-known clustering algorithm, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) allows each input sample to belong to more than one cluster, providing more flexibility than non-fuzzy clustering methods. However, the accuracy of FCM is subject to false detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of the algorithm in some cases. The false detections are very important in some decision-making application domains like network security and medical diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to catastrophic outcomes. They mainly emerge from making decisions about a subset of records that do not provide sufficient evidence to make a good decision. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in FCM by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. This approach enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the error rate. Most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error rate preventing performance loss which is common in similar hybrid methods. Experimental results of applying the proposed method on several datasets from different domains show a significant decrease in error rate as well as improved sensitivity of the algorithm.

392,"Automated environmental compliance checking requires automated extraction of rules from environmental regulatory textual documents such as energy conservation codes and EPA regulations. Automated rule extraction requires complex text processing and analysis for information extraction and subsequent formalization of the extracted information into computer-processable rules. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the text is first classified into predefined categories before information extraction (IE). The advantages are that irrelevant text will be filtered out during text classification (TC) and text with similar semantic meaning will be grouped, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of further IE and compliance reasoning (CR). The categories used for TC are predefined in a semantic TC topic hierarchy, and the classified text is subsequently used in semantic IE and semantic CR. This paper presents the proposed machine learning (ML)-based TC algorithm for classifying clauses in environmental regulatory documents based on the TC topic hierarchy. In developing the algorithm, different text preprocessing techniques, ML algorithms, and performance improvement strategies were tested and used. The final TC algorithm was tested on 10 environmental regulatory documents and evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The algorithm achieved approximately 97 and 84% average recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data.

393,"Aim: Oxytocin regulates food intake, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and urinary sodium excretion. We assessed the association between serum oxytocin levels and presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in older men. Methods: Cross-sectional study was performed in 540 volunteer men aged 50-85 yrs from the MINOS cohort. Oxytocin was measured in fasting serum by radioimmunoassay (Oxytocin RIA, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals). MetS was diagnosed using the harmonized definition. Results: Serum oxytocin was higher in 166 men with MetS vs. controls (p < 0.005). After adjustment for confounders including leptin, higher oxytocin was associated with higher odds of MetS (OR = 1.38 per SD, 95% CI: 1.10-1.71, p0.74 pg/mL (median) had higher odds of MetS vs. men with oxytocin 60.74 pg/mL (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.33-3.18, p0.74 pg/mL and total testosterone < 300 ng/dL (< 10.4 nmol/L) had higher odds of MetS vs. men without these characteristics (OR = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.65-9.46, p < 0.005). Men having 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels0.74 pg/mL had higher odds of MetS vs. men without these characteristics (OR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.47-5.58, p0.74 pg/mL and osteocalcin levels < 14.6 ng/mL (lowest quartile) had higher odds of MetS vs. men without these characteristics (OR = 4.12, 95% CI: 2.07-8.20, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In older men, higher serum oxytocin levels are associated with higher odds of MetS regardless of potential confounders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

394,"As one of the most developed intelligent operating systems on mobile devices, Android has taken the most part of the cell phone market. A rapid increase in the number of mobile applications make them more and more relevant to people's daily lives than ever before. Due to Android's security mechanism and the validation lack of publishing Android apps, Android malware detection still remains to be a critical issue. To solve this problem, this paper found that the statistical information of Android components (mainly activity) from the Manifest file cannot be ignored, based on the traditional method of Android permission detection. In this paper, a new feature vector is extracted from the AndroidManifest file, which combines the permission information and the component information of the Android application. We combine the naive Bias classification algorithm, and propose a malicious application detection method based on AndroidManifest file information. The experimental results show that the new method performance better than that of the traditional permission detection.

395,"Aim. To evaluate the efficiency of interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Subjects and methods. A total of 61 patients (41 with ET and 20 with PV) were examined. Prior to study enrolment, 44 (72%) patients with ET or PV received one or other therapy (aspirin was not taken into account). The mean Jak2V617F mutant allele at baseline was 23% (6-54%) in the patients with ET and 40% (11-88%) in those with PV. The median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 49 months. Results. The paper presents the clinical and molecular findings of long-term INF-alpha therapy in patients with ET or PV. The median follow-up was 52 months. Recombinant IFN-alpha(2) showed its ability to induce complete hematologic remission (ET (76%), PV (70%)) and a complete molecular response. 22 (69%) out of 32 patients were noted to have a smaller number of cells with the Jak2V617F mutation. In the patients with PV and in those with ET, the relative reduction in the proportion of cells with the Jak2V617F mutant gene averaged 85% and 56% of the baseline values, respectively. There was a reduction in the proportion of cells expressing the Jak2V617F mutation in, both the ET (from 12 to 2.2%; p=0.001) and PV (from 32.7% to 3.2%) groups (p=0.001). Ten (31%) patients achieved a deep molecular remission (<= 2% Jak2V617F allele); among them, 5 patients were not found to have Jak2V617F mutation. The obtained molecular response remained in 7 of the 10 patients untreated for 11 to 86 months. The long-term treatment with IFN-alpha led to normalization of the morphological pattern of bone marrow in 5 of the 7 PV or ET patients. Conclusion. Significant molecular remissions achieved by therapy with recombinant interferon -alpha(2) confirm the appropriateness of this treatment option in in the majority of patients with ET or PV.

396,"Automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction of requirements from regulatory textual documents and their formalization in a computer-processable rule representation. Such information extraction (IE) is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based NLP approach for automated IE from construction regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict resolution (CR) rules in IE. A variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the IE and CR rules. Phrase structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed IE algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively.

397,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most disabling diseases to affect large numbers of elderly people worldwide. Because of the characteristics of this disease, patients with AD require daily assistance from service providers both in nursing homes and at home. Domiciliary assistance has been demonstrated to be cost effective and efficient in the first phase of the disease, helping to slow down the course of the illness, improve the quality of life and care, and extend independence for patients and caregivers. In this context, the aim of this work is to demonstrate the technical effectiveness and acceptability of an innovative domiciliary smart sensor system for providing domiciliary assistance to patients with AD which has been developed with an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) approach. Methods: The design, development, testing, and evaluation of the innovative technological solution were performed by a multidisciplinary team. In all, 15 sociomedical operators and 14 patients with AD were directly involved in defining the end-users' needs and requirements, identifying design principles with acceptability and usability features and evaluating the technological solutions before and after the real experimentation. Results: A modular technological system was produced to help caregivers continuously monitor the health status, safety, and daily activities of patients with AD. During the experimentation, the acceptability, utility, usability, and efficacy of this system were evaluated as quite positive. Conclusion: The experience described in this article demonstrated that AAL technologies are feasible and effective nowadays and can be actively used in assisting patients with AD in their homes. The extensive involvement of caregivers in the experimentation allowed to assess that there is, through the use of the technological system, a proven improvement in care performance and efficiency of care provision by both formal and informal caregivers and consequently an increase in the quality of life of patients, their relatives, and their caregivers.

398,"As the basic part of the mechanical transmission, gears should have high transmission accuracy, so the gear's precision measurement is a key technology. Based on the existing research, the computer vision technology is introduced in gear test. According to the definitions of technical indexes, such as pitch deviation, tooth thickness deviation, etc., through analysis and research, a new measurement method is proposed, so as to complete the determination of the modulus, tooth number and total accumulated pitch deviation of a gear. In the proposed methods, those indexes such as the pitch and tooth thickness, are measured in arc length, rather than in chordal length, so that they are consistent with their definitions. And the measured points can be positioned on the reference circle of a gear while the pitch and total accumulative pitch deviations are examined. Finally, a gear is measured with the proposed method. The main test is obtained as follows. The single pitch deviation is 10,3 mu m, total cumulative pitch deviation is 44,8 mu m, and tooth thick deviation is 5,2 mu m. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method is feasible and effective, and can meet the precision need of engineering practice. This study provides a new solution method for the gear's on-line measurement.

399,"Aim: Chronic health conditions are associated with poor academic outcomes. This study examines the relationship between health conditions, specialist health service utilisation and academic performance in Australian children. Methods: This was a quasi-longitudinal study where School Entrant Health Questionnaire (a survey tool with parent report on children's health) data for 24 678 children entering school in 2008 was matched with the 2011 National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN). Linear and logistic regressions were used to examine associations between health conditions, use of a specialist health service and reading and numeracy scores. Results: The study comprised 24 678 children. Children with allergies, very low birth weight, developmental delay, diabetes, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, birth abnormality, speech problems, intellectual disability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had lower numeracy scores than those without any of these conditions (P < 0.05). The same children had higher odds (1.2-5.8) of being at or below the national minimum standard for numeracy. Children with developmental delay, epilepsy, dental problems, speech, intellectual disabilities and low birth weight had lower reading scores than those without these conditions (P < 0.05) and had higher odds of being at (odds ratio: 1.3) or below (odds ratio: 3.7) the national minimum standard for reading. Children with health conditions who had ever accessed specialist health services did not differ in their academic performance from those that had not used specialist health services. Conclusions: Some health conditions put children at risk of poorer academic performance, and interventions to prevent this such as appropriate support services in schools should be considered.
